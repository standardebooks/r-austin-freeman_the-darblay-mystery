			</hgroup>
			<p>There are certain districts in London the appearance of which conveys to the observer the impression that the houses, and indeed, the entire streets, have been picked up secondhand. There is in this aspect a grey, colourless, mouldy quality, reminiscent, not of the antique shop, but rather of the marine store dealers; a quality which even communicates itself to the inhabitants, so that one gathers the impression that the whole neighbourhood was taken as a going concern.</p>
			<p>It was on such a district that I found myself looking down from the top of an omnibus a few days after the inquest (<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Cornish’s brougham being at the moment under repairs and his horse “out to grass” during the slack season), being bound for a street in the neighbourhood of Hoxton⁠—Market Street by name⁠—which abutted, as I had noticed when making out my route, on the Regent’s Canal. The said route I had written out, and now, in the intervals of my surveys of the unlovely prospect, I divided my attention between it and the note which had summoned me to these remote regions.</p>
			<p>Concerning the latter I was somewhat curious, for the envelope was addressed, not to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Cornish, but to “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Stephen Gray.” This was really quite an odd circumstance. Either the writer knew me personally or was aware that I was acting as locum tenens for Cornish. But the name⁠—James Morris⁠—was unknown to me, and a careful inspection of the index of the ledger had failed to bring to light anyone answering to the description. So <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Morris was presumably a stranger to my principal also. The note, which had been left by hand in the morning, requested me to call “as early in the forenoon as possible,” which seemed to hint at some degree of urgency. Naturally, as a young practitioner, I speculated with interest, not entirely unmingled with anxiety, on the possible nature of the case, and also on the patient’s reasons for selecting a medical attendant whose residence was so inconveniently far away.</p>
			<p>In accordance with my written route, I got off the omnibus at the corner of Shepherdess Walk, and pursuing that pastoral thoroughfare for some distance, presently plunged into a labyrinth of streets adjoining it and succeeded most effectually in losing myself. However, inquiries addressed to an intelligent fish-vendor elicited a most lucid direction and I soon found myself in a little, drab street which justified its name by giving accommodation to a row of stationary barrows loaded with what looked like the “throw-outs” from a colossal spring clean. Passing along this kerbside market and reflecting (like Diogenes, in similar circumstances) how many things there were in the world that I did not want, I walked slowly up the street looking for Number 23⁠—my patient’s number⁠—and the canal which I had seen on the map. I located them both at the same instant, for Number 23 turned out to be the last house on the opposite side, and a few yards beyond it the street was barred by a low wall, over which, as I looked, the mast of a sailing-barge came into view and slowly crept past. I stepped up to the wall and looked over. Immediately beneath me was the towing-path, alongside which the barge was now bringing up and beginning to lower her mast, apparently in order to pass under a bridge that spanned the canal some two hundred yards farther along.</p>
			<p>From these nautical manoeuvres I transferred my attention to my patient’s house⁠—or, at least, so much of it as I could see; for Number 23 appeared to consist of a shop with nothing over it. There was, however, in a wall which extended to the canal wall a side door with a bell and knocker, so I inferred that the house was behind the shop, and that the latter had been built on a formerly existing front garden. The shop itself was somewhat reminiscent of the stalls down the street, for though the fascia was newly painted (with the inscription “J. Morris, General Dealer”) the stock-in-trade exhibited in the window was in the last stage of senile decay. It included, I remember, a cracked Toby jug, a mariner’s sextant of an obsolete type, a Dutch clock without hands, a snuffbox, one or two plaster statuettes, an invalid punch-bowl, a shiny, dark, and inscrutable oil painting and a plaster mask, presumably the death mask of some celebrity whose face was unknown to me.</p>
			<p>My examination of this collection was brought to a sudden end by the apparition of a face above the half-blind of the glazed shop-door; the face of a middle-aged woman who seemed to be inspecting me with malevolent interest. Assuming⁠—rather too late⁠—a brisk, professional manner, I opened the shop door, thereby setting a bell jangling within, and confronted the owner of the face.</p>
			<p>“I am <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Gray,” I began to explain.</p>
			<p>“Side door,” she interrupted brusquely. “Ring the bell and knock.”</p>
			<p>I backed out hastily and proceeded to follow the directions, giving a tug at the bell and delivering a flourish on the knocker. The hollow reverberations of the latter almost suggested an empty house, but my vigorous pull at the bell-handle produced no audible result, from which I inferred⁠—wrongly, as afterwards appeared⁠—that it was out of repair. After waiting quite a considerable time, I was about to repeat the performance when I heard sounds within; and then the door was opened, to my surprise, by the identical sour-faced woman whom I had seen in the shop. As her appearance and manner did not invite conversation, and she uttered no word, I followed her in silence through a long passage, or covered way, which ran parallel to the side of the shop and presumably crossed the site of the garden. It ended at a door which opened into the hall proper; a largish square space into which the doors of the ground-floor rooms opened. It contained the main staircase and was closed in at the farther end by a heavy curtain which extended from wall to wall.</p>
			<p>We proceeded in this funereal manner up the stairs to the first floor on the landing of which my conductress halted and for the first time broke the silence.</p>
			<p>“You will probably find <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bendelow asleep or dozing,” she said in a rather gruff voice. “If he is, there is no need for you to disturb him.”</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bendelow!” I exclaimed. “I understood that his name was Morris.”</p>
			<p>“Well, it isn’t,” she retorted. “It is Bendelow. My name is Morris and so is my husband’s. It was he who wrote to you.”</p>
			<p>“By the way,” said I, “how did he know my name? I am acting for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Cornish, you know.”</p>
			<p>“I didn’t know,” said she, “and I don’t suppose he did. Probably the servant told him. But it doesn’t matter. Here you are, and you will do as well as another. I was telling you about <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bendelow. He is in a pretty bad way. The specialist whom <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Morris took him to⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Artemus Cropper⁠—said he had cancer of the bi-lorus, whatever that is⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Pylorus,” I corrected.</p>
			<p>“Well, pylorus, then, if you prefer it,” she said impatiently. “At any rate, whatever it is, he’s got cancer of it; and, as I said before, he is in a pretty bad way. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Cropper told us what to do, and we are doing it. He wrote out full directions as to diet⁠—I will show them to you presently⁠—and he said that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bendelow was to have a dose of morphia if he complained of pain⁠—which he does, of course; and that, as there was no chance of his getting better, it didn’t matter how much morphia he had. The great thing was to keep him out of pain. So we give it to him twice a day⁠—at least, my husband does⁠—and that keeps him fairly comfortable. In fact, he sleeps most of the time, and is probably dozing now; so you are not likely to get much out of him, especially as he is rather hard of hearing even when he is awake. And now you had better come in and have a look at him.”</p>
			<p>She advanced to the door of a room and opened it softly, and I followed in a somewhat uncomfortable frame of mind. It seemed to me that I had no function but that of a mere figurehead. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Cropper, whom I knew by name as a physician of some reputation, had made the diagnosis and prescribed the treatment, neither of which I, as a mere beginner, would think of contesting. It was an unsatisfactory, even an ignominious, position from which my professional pride revolted. But apparently it had to be accepted.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bendelow was a most remarkable-looking man. Probably he had always been somewhat peculiar in appearance; but now the frightful emaciation (which strongly confirmed Cropper’s diagnosis) had so accentuated his original peculiarities that he had the appearance of some dreadful, mirthless caricature. Under the influence of the remorseless disease, every structure which was capable of shrinking had shrunk to the vanishing-point, leaving the unshrinkable skeleton jutting out with a most horrible and grotesque effect. His great hooked nose, which must always have been strikingly prominent, stuck out now, thin and sharp, like the beak of some bird of prey. His heavy, beetling brows, which must always have given to his face a frowning sullenness, now overhung sockets which had shrunk away into mere caverns. His naturally high cheekbones were now not only prominent, but exhibited the details of their structure as one sees them in a dry skull. Altogether, his aspect was at once pitiable and forbidding. Of his age I could form no estimate. He might have been a hundred. The wonder was that he was still alive; that there was yet left in that shrivelled body enough material to enable its mechanism to continue its functions.</p>
			<p>He was not asleep, but was in that somnolent, lethargic state that is characteristic of the effects of morphia. He took no notice of me when I approached the bed, nor even when I spoke his name somewhat loudly.</p>
			<p>“I told you you wouldn’t get much out of him,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Morris, looking at me with a sort of grim satisfaction. “He doesn’t have a great deal to say to any of us nowadays.”</p>
			<p>“Well,” said I, “there is no need to rouse him, but I had better just examine him, if only as a matter of form. I can’t take the case entirely on hearsay.”</p>
			<p>“I suppose not,” she agreed. “You know best. Do what you think necessary, but don’t disturb him more than you can help.”</p>
			<p>It was not a prolonged examination. The first touch of my fingers on the shrunken abdomen made me aware of the unmistakable hard mass and rendered further exploration needless. There could be no doubt as to the nature of the case or of what the future held in store. It was only a question of time, and a short time at that.</p>
			<p>The patient submitted to the examination quite passively, but he seemed to be fully aware of what was going on, for he looked at me in a sort of drunken, dreamy fashion, but without any sign of interest in my proceedings. When I had finished, I looked him over again, trying to reconstitute him as he might have been before this deadly disease fastened on him. I observed that he seemed to have a fair crop of hair of a darkish iron-grey. I say “seemed,” because the greater part of his head was covered by a skull cap of black silk; but a fringe of hair straying from under it on to the forehead suggested that he was not bald. His teeth, too, which were rather conspicuous, were natural teeth and in good preservation. In order to verify this fact, I stooped and raised his lip the better to examine them. But at this point <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Morris intervened.</p>
			<p>“There, that will do,” she said impatiently. “You are not a dentist, and his teeth will last as long as he will want them. If you have finished you had better come with me and I will show you <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Cropper’s prescriptions. Then you can tell me if you have any further directions to give.”</p>
			<p>She led the way out of the room, and when I had made a farewell gesture to the patient (of which he took no notice) I followed her down the stairs to the ground floor where she ushered me into a small, rather elegantly furnished room. Here she opened the flap of a bureau and from one of the little drawers took an open envelope which she handed to me. It contained one or two prescriptions for occasional medicines, and a sheet of directions relative to the diet and general management of the patient, including the administration of morphia. The latter read, under the general heading, “Simon Bendelow, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Esq.</abbr>”:</p>
			<p>“As the case progresses, it will probably be necessary to administer morphine regularly, but the amount given should, if possible, be restricted to ¼ gr. Morph. Sulph., not more than twice a day; but, of course, the hopeless prognosis and probable early termination of the case make some latitude admissible.”</p>
			<p>Although I was in complete agreement with the writer, I was a little puzzled by these documents. They were signed “Artemus Cropper, M.D.,” but they were not addressed to any person by name. They appeared to have been given to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Morris, in whose possession they now were; but the use of the word “morphine” instead of the more familiar “morphia” and the generally technical phraseology seemed inappropriate to directions addressed to lay persons. As I returned them I remarked:</p>
			<p>“These directions read as if they had been intended for the information of a medical man.”</p>
			<p>“They were,” she replied. “They were meant for the doctor who was attending <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bendelow at the time. When we moved to this place I got them from him to show to the new doctor. You are the new doctor.”</p>
			<p>“Then you haven’t been here very long?”</p>
			<p>“No,” she replied. “We have only just moved in. And that reminds me that our stock of morphia is running out. Could you bring a fresh tube of the tabloids next time you call? My husband left an empty tube for me to give you to remind you what size the tabloids are. He gives <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bendelow the injections.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you,” said I, “but I don’t want the empty tube. I read the prescription and shan’t forget the dose. I will bring a new tube tomorrow⁠—that is, if you want me to call every day. It seems hardly necessary.”</p>
			<p>“No, it doesn’t,” she agreed. “I should think twice a week would be quite enough. Monday and Thursday would suit me best; if you could manage to come about this time I should be sure to be in. My time is rather taken up, as I haven’t a servant at present.”</p>
			<p>It was a bad arrangement. Fixed appointments are things to avoid in medical practice. Nevertheless I agreed to it⁠—subject to unforeseen obstacles⁠—and was forthwith conducted back along the covered way and launched into the outer world with a farewell which it would be inadequate to describe as unemotional.</p>
			<p>As I turned away from the door I cast a passing glance at the shop window; and once again I perceived a face above the half-blind. It was a man’s face this time; presumably the face of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Morris. And, like his wife, he seemed to be “taking stock of me.” I returned the attention, and carried away with me the instantaneous mental photograph of a man in that unprepossessing transitional state between being clean-shaved and wearing a beard which is characterized by a sort of grubby prickliness that disfigures the features without obscuring them. His stubble was barely a week old, but as his complexion and hair were dark, the effect was very untidy and disreputable. And yet, as I have said, it did not obscure the features. I was even able, in that momentary glance, to note a detail which would probably have escaped a non-medical eye: the scar of a harelip which had been very neatly and skilfully mended, and which a moustache would probably have concealed altogether.</p>
			<p>I did not, however, give much thought to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Morris. It was his dour-faced wife, with her gruff, overbearing manner who principally occupied my reflections. She seemed to have divined in some way that I was but a beginner⁠—perhaps my youthful appearance gave her the hint⁠—and to have treated me with almost open contempt. In truth my position was not a very dignified one. The diagnosis of the case had been made for me, the treatment had been prescribed for me, and was being carried out by other hands than mine. My function was to support a kind of legal fiction that I was conducting the case, but principally to supply the morphia (which a chemist might have refused to do), and when the time came, to sign the death certificate. It was an ignominious role for a young and ambitious practitioner, and my pride was disposed to boggle at it. But yet there was nothing to which I could object. The diagnosis was undoubtedly correct, and the treatment and management of the case exactly such as I should have prescribed. Finally I decided that my dissatisfaction was principally due to the unattractive personality of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Morris; and with this conclusion I dismissed the case from my mind and let my thoughts wander into more agreeable channels.</p>
