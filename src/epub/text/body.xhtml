<h2>CHAPTER I. <br/> The Pool in the Wood</h2>

<p>There are certain days in our lives which, as we recall
them, seem to detach themselves from the general
sequence as forming the starting-point of a new epoch.
Doubtless, if we examined them critically, we should find
them to be but links in a connected chain. But in a
retrospective glance their continuity with the past is
unperceived, and we see them in relation to the events
which followed them rather than to those which went
before.</p>

<p>Such a day is that on which I look back through a
vista of some twenty years; for on that day I was,
suddenly and without warning, plunged into the very heart
of a drama so strange and incredible that in the recital
of its events I am conscious of a certain diffidence and
hesitation.</p>

<p>The picture that rises before me as I write is very clear
and vivid. I see myself, a youngster of twenty-five, the
owner of a brand-new medical diploma, wending my way
gaily down Wood-lane, Highgate, at about eight o’clock
on a sunny morning in early autumn. I was taking a
day’s holiday, the last I was likely to enjoy for some
time; for on the morrow I was to enter on the duties
of my first professional appointment. I had nothing in
view to-day but sheer, delightful idleness. It is true that
a sketch-book in one pocket and a box of collecting-tubes
in another suggested a bare hint of purpose in the
expedition; but primarily it was a holiday, a pleasure jaunt,
to which art and science were no more than possible
sources of contributory satisfaction.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the lane was the entrance to
Church-yard Bottom Wood, then open and unguarded
save by a few hurdles (it has since been enclosed and
re-named “Queen’s Wood”). I entered and took my way
along the broad, rough path, pleasantly conscious of the
deep silence and seeming remoteness of this surviving
remnant of the primeval forest of Britain, and letting
my thoughts stray to the great plague-pit in the haunted
wood that gave the place its name. The foliage of the
oaks was still unchanged despite the waning of the year.
The low-slanting sunlight spangled it with gold and made
rosy patterns on the path, where lay a few prematurely
fallen leaves; but in the hollows among the undergrowth
traces of the night-mists lingered, shrouding tree-bole,
bush, and fern in a mystery of gauzy blue.</p>

<p>A turn of the path brought me suddenly within a few
paces of a girl who was stooping at the entrance to a
side-track, and seemed to be peering into the undergrowth
as if looking for something. As I appeared, she stood
up and looked round at me with a startled, apprehensive
manner that caused me to look away and pass as if I
had not seen her. But the single glance had shown me
that she was a strikingly handsome girl—indeed, I should
have used the word “beautiful”; that she seemed to be
about my own age, and that she was evidently a lady.</p>

<p>The apparition, pleasant as it was, set me speculating
as I strode forward. It was early for a girl like this to
be afoot in the woods, and alone, too. Not so very safe,
either, as she had seemed to realize, judging by the start
that my approach seemed to have given her. And what
could it be that she was looking for? Had she lost
something at some previous time and come to search for it
before any one was about? It might be so. Certainly
she was not a poacher, for there was nothing to poach,
and she hardly had the manner or appearance of a
naturalist.</p>

<p>A little farther on I struck into a side path which led,
as I knew, in the direction of a small pond. That pond
I had had in my mind when I put the box of collecting-tubes
in my pocket, and I now made my way to it as
directly as the winding track would let me; but still it
was not the pond or its inmates that occupied my thoughts,
but the mysterious maiden whom I had left peering into
the undergrowth. Perhaps if she had been less
attractive I might have given her less consideration. But I
was twenty-five; and if a man at twenty-five has not a
keen and appreciative eye for a pretty girl, there must
be something radically wrong with his mental make-up.</p>

<p>In the midst of my reflections I came out into a largish
opening in the wood, at the centre of which, in a slight
hollow, was the pond: a small oval piece of water, fed
by the trickle of a tiny stream, the continuation of which
carried away the overflow towards the invisible valley.</p>

<p>Approaching the margin, I brought out my box of tubes
and, uncorking one, stooped and took a trial dip. When
I held the glass tube against the light and examined its
contents through my pocket lens I found that I was in
luck. The “catch” included a green hydra, clinging to
a rootlet of duckweed, several active water-fleas, a scarlet
water-mite, and a beautiful sessile rotifer. Evidently this
pond was a rich hunting ground.</p>

<p>Delighted with my success, I corked the tube, put it
away, and brought out another, with which I took a fresh
dip. This was less successful, but the naturalist’s ardour
and the collector’s cupidity being thoroughly aroused, I
persevered, gradually enriching my collection and
working my way slowly round the margin of the pond,
forgetful of everything—even of the mysterious maiden—but
the objects of my search; indeed, so engrossed was I
with my pursuit of the minute denizens of this watery
world that I failed to observe a much larger object which
must have been in view most of the time. Actually, I did
not see it until I was right over it. Then, as I was
stooping to clear away the duckweed for a fresh dip, I found
myself confronted by a human face, just below the
surface and half-concealed by the pond-weed.</p>

<p>It was a truly appalling experience. Utterly
unprepared for this awful apparition, I was so overcome by
astonishment and horror that I remained stooping, with
motion arrested, as if petrified, staring at the thing in
silence and hardly breathing. The face was that of a
man of about fifty or a little more: a handsome, refined,
rather intellectual face, with a moustache and Vandyke
beard, and surmounted by a thickish growth of iron-grey
hair. Of the rest of the body little was to be seen, for
the duckweed and water-crowfoot had drifted over it, and
I had no inclination to disturb them.</p>

<p>Recovering somewhat from the shock of this sudden
and fearful encounter, I stood up and rapidly considered
what I had better do. It was clearly not for me to make
any examination or meddle with the corpse in any way;
indeed, when I considered the early hour and the
remoteness of this solitary place, it seemed prudent to avoid the
possibility of being seen there by any chance stranger.
Thus reflecting, with my eyes still riveted on the pallid,
impassive face, so strangely sleeping below the glassy
surface and conveying to me somehow a dim sense of
familiarity, I pocketed my tubes, and, turning back, stole away
along the woodland track, treading lightly, almost
stealthily, as one escaping from the scene of a crime.</p>

<p>Very different was my mood, as I retraced my steps,
from that in which I had come. Gone was all my gaiety
and holiday spirit. The dread meeting had brought me
into an atmosphere of tragedy, perchance even of
something more than tragedy. With death I was familiar
enough; death as it comes to men, prefaced by sickness
or even by injury. But the dead man who lay in that
still and silent pool in the heart of the wood had come
there by none of the ordinary chances of normal life. It
seemed barely possible that he could have fallen in by
mere misadventure, for the pond was too shallow and its
bottom shelved too gently for accidental drowning to be
conceivable. Nor was the strange, sequestered spot
without significance. It was just such a spot as might well
be chosen by one who sought to end his life—or
another’s.</p>

<p>I had nearly reached the main path when an abrupt
turn of the narrow track brought me once more face to
face with the girl whose existence I had till now
forgotten. She was still peering into the dense undergrowth
as if searching for something; and again, on my sudden
appearance, she turned a startled face towards me. But
this time I did not look away. Something in her face
struck me with a nameless fear. It was not only that
she was pale and haggard, but that her expression
betokened anxiety and even terror. As I looked at her I
understood in a flash the dim sense of familiarity of which
I had been conscious in the pallid face beneath the water.
It was her face that it had recalled.</p>

<p>With my heart in my mouth, I halted and, taking off
my cap, addressed her.</p>

<p>“Pray pardon me; you seem to be searching for
something. Can I help you in any way or give you any
information?”</p>

<p>She looked at me a little shyly and, as I thought,
with slight distrust, but she answered civilly enough,
though rather stiffly:</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I am afraid you can’t help me. I am
not in need of any assistance.”</p>

<p>This, under ordinary circumstances, would have
brought the interview to an abrupt end. But the
circumstances were not ordinary, and as she made as if to
pass me I ventured to persist.</p>

<p>“Please,” I urged, “don’t think me impertinent, but
would you mind telling me what you are looking for? I
have a reason for asking, and it isn’t curiosity.”</p>

<p>She reflected for a few moments before replying, and
I feared that she was about to administer another snub.
Then, without looking at me, she replied:</p>

<p>“I am looking for my father” (and at these words my
heart sank). “He did not come home last night. He left
Hornsey to come home, and he would ordinarily have
come by the path through the wood. He always came
that way from Hornsey. So I am looking through the
wood in case he missed his way, or was taken ill, or⸺”</p>

<p>Here the poor girl suddenly broke off, and, letting her
dignity go, burst into tears. I huskily murmured a few
indistinct words of condolence, but, in truth, I was little
less affected than she was. It was a terrible position, but
there was no escape from it. The corpse that I had just
seen was almost certainly her father’s corpse. At any
rate, the question whether it was or not had to be settled
now, and settled by me—and her. That was quite clear;
but yet I could not screw my courage up to the point of
telling her. While I was hesitating, however, she forced
the position by a direct question.</p>

<p>“You said just now that you had a reason for asking
what I was searching for. Would it be⸺?” She
paused and looked at me inquiringly as she wiped her
eyes.</p>

<p>I made a last, frantic search for some means of
breaking the horrid news to her. Of course there was none.
Eventually I stammered:</p>

<p>“The reason I asked was—er—the fact is that I have
just seen the body of a man lying⸺”</p>

<p>“Where?” she demanded. “Show me the place!”</p>

<p>Without replying, I turned and began quickly to
retrace my steps along the narrow track. A few minutes
brought me to the opening in which the pond was
situated, and I was just beginning to skirt the margin,
closely followed by my companion, when I heard her
utter a low, gasping cry. The next moment she had
passed me and was running along the bank towards a spot
where I could now see the toe of a boot just showing
through the duckweed. I stopped short and watched her
with my heart in my throat. Straight to the fatal spot
she ran, and for a moment stood on the brink, stooping
over the weedy surface. Then, with a terrible, wailing
cry, she stepped into the water.</p>

<p>Instantly I ran forward and waded into the pond to
her side. Already she had her arms round the dead
man’s neck and was raising the face above the surface.
I saw that she meant to bring the body ashore, and,
useless as it was, it seemed a natural thing to do. Silently
I passed my arms under the corpse and lifted it;
and as she supported the head we bore it through
the shallows and up the bank, where I laid it down
gently in the high grass.</p>

<p>Not a word had been spoken, nor was there any
question that need be asked. The pitiful tale told itself only
too plainly. As I stood looking with swimming eyes at
the tragic group, a whole history seemed to unfold itself;
a history of love and companionship, of a happy, peaceful
past made sunny by mutual affection, shattered in an
instant by the hideous present, with its portent of a sad
and lonely future. She had sat down on the grass and
taken the dead head on her lap, tenderly wiping the face
with her handkerchief, smoothing the grizzled hair and
crooning or moaning words of endearment into the
insensible ears. She had forgotten my presence: indeed,
she was oblivious of everything but the still form that
bore the outward semblance of her father.</p>

<p>Some minutes passed thus. I stood a little apart, cap
in hand, more moved than I had ever been in my life,
and, naturally enough, unwilling to break in upon a
grief so overwhelming and, as it seemed to me, so
sacred. But presently it began to be borne in on me that
something had to be done. The body would have to be
removed from this place, and the proper authorities
ought to be notified. Still, it was some time before I
could gather courage to intrude on her sorrow; to
profane her grief with the sordid realities of everyday life.
At last I braced myself up for the effort, and addressed
her.</p>

<p>“Your father,” I said gently—I could not refer to
him as “the body”—“will have to be taken away from
here; and the proper persons will have to be informed
of what has happened. Shall I go alone, or will you
come with me? I don’t like to leave you here.”</p>

<p>She looked up at me, and to my relief answered me
with quiet composure:</p>

<p>“I can’t leave him here all alone. I must stay with
him until he is taken away. Do you mind telling
whoever ought to be told”—like me, she instinctively avoided
the word “police”—“and making what arrangements are
necessary?”</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said; and loath as I
was to leave her alone with the dead, my heart assented
to her decision. In her place, I should have had the
same feeling. Accordingly, with a promise to return as
quickly as I could, I stole away along the woodland
track. When I turned to take a last glance at her before
plunging into the wood, she was once more leaning over
the head that lay in her lap, looking with fond grief into
the impassive face and stroking the dank hair.</p>

<p>My intention had been to go straight to the police-station,
when I had ascertained its whereabouts, and
make my report to the officer in charge. But a fortunate
chance rendered this proceeding unnecessary, for, at the
moment when I emerged from the top of Wood-lane,
I saw a police-officer, mounted on a bicycle—a road
patrol, as I assumed him to be—approaching along the
Archway-road. I hailed him to stop, and as he
dismounted and stepped on to the footway I gave him a
brief account of the finding of the body and my meeting
with the daughter of the dead man. He listened with
calm, business-like interest, and, when I had finished,
said:</p>

<p>“We had better get the body removed as quickly as
possible. I will run along to the station and get the
wheeled stretcher. There is no need for you to come.
If you will go back and wait for us at the entrance to
the wood that will save time. We shall be there within
a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>I agreed gladly to this arrangement, and when I had
seen him mount his machine and shoot away along the
road, I turned back down the Lane and re-entered the
wood. Before taking up my post, I walked quickly
down the path and along the track to the opening by the
pond. My new friend was sitting just as I had left her,
but she looked up as I emerged from the track and
advanced towards her. I told her briefly what had
happened and was about to retire when she asked: “Will
they take him to our house?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” I replied. “There will have to
be an inquiry by the coroner, and until that is finished
his body will have to remain in the mortuary.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid it might be so,” she said with quiet
resignation; and as she spoke she looked down with
infinite sadness at the waxen face in her lap. A good
deal relieved by her reasonable acceptance of the painful
necessities, I turned back and made my way to the
rendezvous at the entrance to the wood.</p>

<p>As I paced to and fro on the shady path, keeping a
look-out up the Lane, my mind was busy with the tragedy
to which I had become a party. It was a grievous affair.
The passionate grief which I had witnessed spoke of
no common affection. On one life at least this disaster
had inflicted irreparable loss, and there were probably
others on whom the blow had yet to fall. But it was not
only a grievous affair; it was highly mysterious. The
dead man had apparently been returning home at night
in a customary manner and by a familiar way. That he
could have strayed by chance from the open, well-worn
path into the recesses of the wood was inconceivable,
while the hour and the circumstances made it almost as
incredible that he should have been wandering in the
wood by choice. And again, the water in which he had
been lying was quite shallow; so shallow as to rule out
accidental drowning as an impossibility.</p>

<p>What could the explanation be? There seemed to be
but three possibilities, and two of them could hardly be
entertained. The idea of intoxication I rejected at once.
The girl was evidently a lady, and her father was
presumably a gentleman, who would not be likely to be
wandering abroad drunk; nor could a man who was
sober enough to have reached the pond have been so
helpless as to be drowned in its shallow waters. To
suppose that he might have fallen into the water in a
fit was to leave unexplained the circumstance of his
being in that remote place at such an hour. The only
possibility that remained was that of suicide; and I could
not but admit that some of the appearances seemed to
support that view. The solitary place—more solitary
still at night—was precisely such as an intending suicide
might be expected to seek; the shallow water presented
no inconsistency; and when I recalled how I had found
his daughter searching the wood with evident foreboding
of evil, I could not escape the feeling that the
dreadful possibility had not been entirely unforeseen.</p>

<p>My meditations had reached this point when, as I
turned once more towards the entrance and looked up
the Lane, I saw two constables approaching, trundling a
wheeled stretcher, while a third man, apparently an
inspector, walked by its side. As the little procession
reached the entrance, and I turned back to show the way,
the latter joined me and began at once to interrogate
me. I gave him my name, address, and occupation, and
followed this with a rapid sketch of the facts as known
to me, which he jotted down in a large notebook, and
he then said:</p>

<p>“As you are a doctor, you can probably tell me how
long the man had been dead when you first saw him.”</p>

<p>“By the appearance and the rigidity,” I replied, “I
should say about nine or ten hours; which agrees pretty
well with the account his daughter gave of his
movements.”</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. “The man and the young
lady,” said he, “are strangers to you, I understand. I
suppose you haven’t picked up anything that would throw
any light on the affair?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered; “I know nothing but what I have
told you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he remarked, “it’s a queer business. It is a
queer place for a man to be in at night, and he must
have gone there of his own accord. But there, it is no
use guessing. It will all be thrashed out at the inquest.”</p>

<p>As he reached this discreet conclusion, we came out
into the opening and I heard him murmur very feelingly,
“Dear, dear! Poor thing.” The girl seemed hardly
to have changed her position since I had last seen her,
but she now tenderly laid the dead head on the grass and
rose as we approached; and I saw with great concern
that her skirts were soaked almost from the waist
downwards.</p>

<p>The officer took off his cap and as he drew near
looked down gravely but with an inquisitive eye at the
dead man. Then he turned to the girl and said in a
singularly gentle and deferential manner:</p>

<p>“This is a very terrible thing, Miss. A dreadful
thing. I assure you that I am more sorry for you than
I can tell; and I hope you will forgive me for having
to intrude on your sorrow by asking questions. I won’t
trouble you more than I can help.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she replied quietly. “Of course I realize
your position. What do you want me to tell you?”</p>

<p>“I understand,” replied the inspector, “that this poor
gentleman was your father. Would you mind telling me
who he was and where he lived and giving me your own
name and address?”</p>

<p>“My father’s name,” she answered, “was Julius
D’Arblay. His private address was Ivy Cottage, North
Grove, Highgate. His studio and workshop, where he
carried on the profession of a modeller, is in
Abbey-road, Hornsey. My name is Marion D’Arblay, and I
lived with my father. He was a widower and I was
his only child.”</p>

<p>As she concluded, with a slight break in her voice,
the inspector shook his head, and again murmured, “Dear,
dear,” as he rapidly entered her answers in his notebook.
Then, in a deeply apologetic tone, he asked:</p>

<p>“Would you mind telling us what you know as to
how this happened?”</p>

<p>“I know very little,” she replied. “As he did not
come home last night, I went to the studio this morning
quite early to see if he was there. He sometimes stayed
there all night when he was working very late. The
woman who lives in the adjoining house and looks after
the studio, told me that he had been working late last
night, but that he left to come home soon after ten.
He always used to come through the wood because it
was the shortest way and the most pleasant. So when
I learned that he had started to come home, I came to
the wood to see if I could find any traces of him. Then
I met this gentleman, and he told me that he had seen
a dead man in the wood, and⸺” Here she suddenly
broke down, and, sobbing passionately, flung out her
hand towards the corpse.</p>

<p>The inspector shut his notebook and, murmuring some
indistinct words of sympathy, nodded to the constables,
who had drawn up the stretcher a few paces away and
lifted off the cover. On this silent instruction they
approached the body, and, with the inspector’s assistance
and mine, lifted it on to the stretcher without removing
the latter from its carriage. As they picked up the cover
the inspector turned to Miss D’Arblay and said gently
but finally: “You had better not come with us. We must
take him to the mortuary, but you will see him again after
the inquest, when he will be brought to your house if
you wish it.”</p>

<p>She made no objection; but as the constables approached
with the cover she stooped over the stretcher and kissed
the dead man on the forehead. Then she turned away;
the cover was placed in position; the inspector and the
constables saluted reverently, and the stretcher was
wheeled away along the narrow track.</p>

<p>For some time after it had gone, we stood in silence at
the margin of the pond with our eyes fixed on the place
where it had disappeared. I considered in no little
embarrassment what was to be done next. It was most
desirable that Miss D’Arblay should be got home as soon
as possible, and I did not at all like the idea of her going
alone, for her appearance, with her drenched skirts and
her dazed and rather wild expression, was such as to
attract unpleasant attention. But I was a total stranger
to her, and I felt a little shy of pressing my company
on her. However, it seemed a plain duty, and, as I saw
her shiver slightly, I said:</p>

<p>“You had better go home now and change your
clothes. They are very wet. And you have some
distance to go.”</p>

<p>She looked down at her soaked dress and then she
looked at me.</p>

<p>“You are rather wet, too,” she said. “I am afraid
I have given you a great deal of trouble.”</p>

<p>“It is little enough that I have been able to do,” I
replied. “But you must really go home now; and if you
will let me walk with you and see you safely to your
house, I shall be much more easy in my mind.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she replied. “It is kind of you to
offer to see me home, and I am glad not to have to go
alone.”</p>

<p>With this, we walked together to the edge of the
opening, and proceeded in single file along the track to the
main path, and so out into Wood-lane, at the top of
which we crossed the Archway Road into Southwood-lane.
We walked mostly in silence, for I was unwilling
to disturb her meditations with attempts at conversation,
which could only have seemed banal or impertinent. For
her part, she appeared to be absorbed in reflections the
nature of which I could easily guess, and her grief was
too fresh for any thought of distraction. But I found
myself speculating with profound discomfort on what
might be awaiting her at home. It is true that her own
desolate state as an orphan without brothers or sisters
had its compensation in that there was no wife to whom
the dreadful tidings had to be imparted, nor any fellow
orphans to have their bereavement broken to them. But
there must be some one who cared; or, if there were not,
what a terrible loneliness would reign in that house!</p>

<p>“I hope,” I said, as we approached our destination,
“that there is some one at home to share your grief and
comfort you a little.”</p>

<p>“There is,” she replied. “I was thinking of her, and
how grievous it will be to have to tell her: an old
servant and a dear friend. She was my mother’s nurse when
the one was a child and the other but a young girl. She
came to our house when my mother married, and has
managed our home ever since. This will be a terrible
shock to her, for she loved my father dearly—every one
loved him who knew him. And she has been like a
mother to me since my own mother died. I don’t know
how I shall break it to her.”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled as she concluded and I was deeply
troubled to think of the painful homecoming that loomed
before her; but still it was a comfort to know that her
sorrow would be softened by sympathy and loving
companionship, not heightened by the empty desolation that
I had feared.</p>

<p>A few minutes more brought us to the little square—which,
by the way, was triangular—and to a pleasant
little old-fashioned house, on the gate of which was
painted the name, “Ivy Cottage.” In the bay window
on the ground floor I observed a formidable-looking
elderly woman, who was watching our approach with
evident curiosity; which, as we drew nearer and the
state of our clothing became visible, gave place to anxiety
and alarm. Then she disappeared suddenly, to reappear
a few moments later at the open door, where she stood
viewing us both with consternation and me in particular
with profound disfavour.</p>

<p>At the gate Miss D’Arblay halted and held out her
hand. “Good-bye,” she said. “I must thank you some
other time for all your kindness;” and with this she
turned abruptly, and, opening the gate, walked up the
little paved path to the door where the old woman was
waiting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II. <br/> A Conference with Dr. Thorndyke</h2>

<p>The sound of the closing door seemed, as it were, to
punctuate my experiences and to mark the end of a
particular phase. So long as Miss D’Arblay was present,
my attention was entirely taken up by her grief and
distress; but now that I was alone I found myself
considering at large the events of this memorable morning.
What was the meaning of this tragedy? How came this
man to be lying dead in that pool? No common
misadventure seemed to fit the case. A man may easily fall
into deep water and be drowned; may step over a quay-side
in the dark or trip on a mooring-rope or ring-bolt.
But here there was nothing to suggest any possible
accident. The water was hardly two feet deep where the
body was lying and much less close to the edge. If he
had walked in in the dark, he would simply have walked
out again. Besides, how came he there at all? The only
explanation that was intelligible was that he went there
with the deliberate purpose of making away with himself.</p>

<p>I pondered this explanation, and found myself
unwilling to accept it, notwithstanding that his daughter’s
presence in the wood, her obvious apprehension, and her
terrified searching among the underwood seemed to hint
at a definite expectation on her part. But yet that
possibility was discounted by what his daughter had told me
of him. Little as she had said, it was clear that he was
a man universally beloved. Such men, in making the
world a pleasant place for others, make it pleasant for
themselves. They are usually happy men; and happy
men do not commit suicide. Yet, if the idea of suicide
were rejected, what was left? Nothing but an insoluble
mystery.</p>

<p>I turned the problem over again and again as I sat
on the top of the tram (where I could keep my wet
trousers out of sight), not as a matter of mere curiosity
but as one in which I was personally concerned.
Friendships spring up into sudden maturity under great
emotional stress. I had known Marion D’Arblay but an
hour or two, but they were hours which neither of us
would ever forget; and in that brief space she had become
to me a friend who was entitled, as of right, to sympathy
and service. So, as I revolved in my mind the mystery
of this man’s death, I found myself thinking of him
not as a chance stranger but as the father of a friend;
and thus it seemed to devolve upon me to elucidate the
mystery, if possible.</p>

<p>It is true that I had no special qualifications for
investigating an obscure case of this kind, but yet I was
better equipped than most young medical men. For my
hospital, St. Margaret’s, though its medical school was
but a small one, had one great distinction; the chair of
Medical Jurisprudence was occupied by one of the
greatest living authorities on the subject, Dr. John Thorndyke.
To him and his fascinating lectures my mind naturally
turned as I ruminated on the problem; and presently,
when I found myself unable to evolve any reasonable
suggestion, the idea occurred to me to go and lay the
facts before the great man himself.</p>

<p>Once started, the idea took full possession of me, and
I decided to waste no time but to seek him at once. This
was not his day for lecturing at the hospital, but I could
find his address in our school calendar; and as my means,
though modest, allowed of my retaining him in a
regular way, I need have no scruples as to occupying his time.
I looked at my watch. It was even now but a little past
noon. I had time to change and get an early lunch and
still make my visit while the day was young.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later found me walking slowly down
the pleasant, tree-shaded footway of King’s Bench-walk
in the Inner Temple, looking up at the numbers above
the entries. Dr. Thorndyke’s number was 5a, which I
presently discovered inscribed on the keystone of a fine,
dignified brick portico of the seventeenth century, on the
jamb whereof was painted his name as the occupant of
the “1st pair.” I accordingly ascended the first pair, and
was relieved to find that my teacher was apparently at
home; for a massive outer door, above which his name
was painted, stood wide open, revealing an inner door,
furnished with a small, brilliantly burnished brass
knocker, on which I ventured to execute a modest rat-tat.
Almost immediately the door was opened by a small,
clerical-looking gentleman who wore a black linen
apron—and ought, from his appearance, to have had black
gaiters to match—and who regarded me with a look of
polite inquiry.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see Dr. Thorndyke,” said I, adding
discreetly, “on a matter of professional business.”</p>

<p>The little gentleman beamed on me benevolently.
“The doctor,” said he, “has gone to lunch at his club,
but he will be coming in quite shortly. Would you like
to wait for him?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I replied, “I should, if you think I shall
not be disturbing him.”</p>

<p>The little gentleman smiled; that is to say, the
multitudinous wrinkles that covered his face arranged
themselves into a sort of diagram of geniality. It was the
crinkliest smile that I have ever seen, but a singularly
pleasant one.</p>

<p>“The doctor,” said he, “is never disturbed by
professional business. No man is ever disturbed by having
to do what he enjoys doing.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, his eyes turned unconsciously to the table,
on which stood a microscope, a tray of slides and
mounting material, and a small heap of what looked like
dressmaker’s cuttings.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “don’t let me disturb you, if you are
busy.”</p>

<p>He thanked me very graciously, and, having installed
me in an easy chair, sat down at the table and resumed
his occupation, which apparently consisted in isolating
fibres from the various samples of cloth and mounting
them as microscopic specimens. I watched him as he
worked, admiring his neat, precise, unhurried methods,
and speculating on the purpose of his proceedings;
whether he was preparing what one might call museum
specimens, to be kept for reference, or whether these
preparations were related to some particular case. I was
considering whether it would be admissible for me to
ask a question on the subject when he paused in his
work, assuming a listening attitude, with one
hand—holding a mounting-needle—raised and motionless.</p>

<p>“Here comes the doctor,” said he.</p>

<p>I listened intently and became aware of footsteps, very
faint and far away, and only barely perceptible. But
my clerical friend—who must have had the auditory
powers of a watch-dog—had no doubts as to their
identity, for he began quietly to pack all his material on the
tray. Meanwhile the footsteps drew nearer; they turned
in at the entry and ascended the “first pair,” by which
time my crinkly-faced acquaintance had the door open.
The next moment Dr. Thorndyke entered and was duly
informed that “a gentleman was waiting to see” him.</p>

<p>“You under-estimate my powers of observation,
Polton,” he informed his subordinate, with a smile. “I can
see the gentleman distinctly with the naked eye. How
do you do, Gray?”—and he shook my hand cordially.</p>

<p>“I hope I haven’t come at the wrong time, sir,” said
I. “If I have, you must adjourn me. But I want to
consult you about a rather queer case.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Thorndyke. “There is no wrong time
for a queer case. Let me hang up my hat and fill my
pipe and then you can proceed to make my flesh creep.”</p>

<p>He disposed of his hat, and when Mr. Polton had
departed with his tray of material he filled his pipe, laid
a note block on the table, and invited me to begin;
whereupon I gave him a detailed account of what had befallen
me in the course of the morning, to which he listened
with close attention, jotting down an occasional note,
but not interrupting my narrative. When I had finished
he read through his notes and then said:</p>

<p>“It is, of course, evident to you that all the appearances
point to suicide. Have you any reasons, other than those
you have mentioned, for rejecting that view?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” I replied gloomily. “But you have
always taught us to beware of too ready acceptance of
the theory of suicide in doubtful cases.”</p>

<p>He nodded approvingly. “Yes,” he said, “that is a
cardinal principle in medico-legal practice. All other
possibilities should be explored before suicide is accepted.
But our difficulty in this case is that we have hardly
any of the relevant facts. The evidence at the inquest
may make everything clear. On the other hand it may
leave things obscure. But what is your concern with the
case? You are merely a witness to the finding of the
body. The parties are all strangers to you, are they
not?”</p>

<p>“They were,” I replied. “But I feel that some one
ought to keep an eye on things for Miss D’Arblay’s
sake, and circumstances seem to have put the duty on me.
So, as I can afford to pay any costs that are likely to be
incurred, I proposed to ask you to undertake the case—on
a strict business footing, you know, sir.”</p>

<p>“When you speak of my undertaking the case,” said
he, “what is it that is in your mind? What do you want
me to do in the matter?”</p>

<p>“I want you to take any measures that you may think
necessary,” I replied, “to ascertain definitely, if possible,
how this man came by his death.”</p>

<p>He reflected awhile before answering. At length he
said:</p>

<p>“The examination of the body will be conducted by
the person whom the coroner appoints, probably the
police surgeon. I will write to the coroner for
permission to be present at the post-mortem examination. He
will certainly make no difficulties. I will also write to the
police surgeon, who is sure to be quite helpful. If the
post-mortem throws no light on the case—in fact, in
any event—I will instruct a first-class shorthand writer
to attend at the inquest and make a verbatim report of the
evidence; and you, of course, will be present as a witness.
That, I think, is about all that we can do at present.
When we have heard all the evidence, including that
furnished by the body itself, we shall be able to judge
whether the case calls for further investigation. How
will that do?”</p>

<p>“It is all that I could wish,” I answered, “and I am
most grateful to you, sir, for giving your time to the
case. I hope you don’t think I have been unduly
meddlesome.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” he replied warmly. “I think you
have shown a very proper spirit in the way you have
interpreted your neighbourly duties to this poor, bereaved
girl, who, apparently, has no one else to watch over her
interests. And I take it as a compliment from an old
pupil that you should seek my help.”</p>

<p>I thanked him again, very sincerely, and had risen
to take my leave, when he held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Gray, if you are not in a hurry,” said he.
“I hear the pleasant clink of crockery. Let us follow the
example of the eminent Mr. Pepys—though it isn’t
always a safe thing to do—and taste of the ‘China drinke
called Tee,’ while you tell me what you have been doing
since you went forth from the fold.”</p>

<p>It struck me that the sense of hearing was
uncommonly well developed in this establishment, for I had
heard nothing; but a few moments later the door opened
very quietly, and Mr. Polton entered with a tray on
which was a very trim, and even dainty, tea service,
which he set out noiselessly and with a curious neatness
of hand, on a small table placed conveniently between our
chairs.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Polton,” said Thorndyke. “I see you
diagnosed my visitor as a professional brother.”</p>

<p>Polton crinkled benevolently and admitted that he
“thought the gentleman looked like one of us’; and with
this he melted away, closing the door behind him without
a sound.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Thorndyke, as he handed me my tea-cup,
“what have you been doing with yourself since you left
the hospital?”</p>

<p>“Principally looking for a job,” I replied; “and now
I’ve found one—a temporary job, though I don’t know
how temporary. To-morrow I take over the practice of
a man named Cornish in Mecklenburgh-square. Cornish
is a good deal run down, and wants to take a quiet
holiday on the East Coast. He doesn’t know how long he
will be away. It depends on his health; but I have told
him that I am prepared to stay as long as he wants me
to. I hope I shan’t make a mess of the job, but I
know nothing of general practice.”</p>

<p>“You will soon pick it up,” said Thorndyke; “but
you had better get your principal to show you the ropes
before he goes, particularly the dispensing and
bookkeeping. The essentials of practice, you know, but the
little practical details have to be learnt, and you are doing
well to make your first plunge into professional life in a
practice that is a going concern. The experience will
be valuable when you make a start on your own account.”</p>

<p>On this plane of advice and comment our talk
proceeded until I thought that I had stayed long enough,
when I once more rose to depart. Then, as we were
shaking hands, Thorndyke reverted to the object of my
visit.</p>

<p>“I shall not appear in this case unless the coroner
wishes me to,” said he. “I shall consult with the official
medical witness, and he will probably give our joint
conclusions in his evidence; unless we should fail to agree,
which is very unlikely. But you will be present, and you
had better attend closely to the evidence of all the
witnesses and let me have your account of the inquest as
well as the shorthand writer’s report. Good-bye, Gray.
You won’t be far away if you should want my help or
advice.”</p>

<p>I left the precincts of the Temple in a much more
satisfied frame of mind. The mystery which seemed to
me to surround the death of Julius D’Arblay would be
investigated by a supremely competent observer, and I
need not further concern myself with it. Perhaps there
was no mystery at all. Possibly the evidence at the
inquest would supply a simple explanation. At any rate,
it was out of my hands and into those of one
immeasurably more capable and I could now give my undivided
attention to the new chapter of my life that was to open
on the morrow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III. <br/> The Doctor’s Revelations</h2>

<p>It was in the evening of the very day on which I took
up my duties at number 61 Mecklenburgh-square that
the little blue paper was delivered summoning me to
attend at the inquest on the following day. Fortunately,
Dr. Cornish’s practice was not of a highly strenuous
type, and the time of year tended to a small visiting list,
so that I had no difficulty in making the necessary
arrangements. In fact, I made them so well that I was
the first to arrive at the little building in which the
inquiry was to be held and was admitted by the
caretaker to the empty room. A few minutes later, however,
the inspector made his appearance, and while I was
exchanging a few words with him the jury began to straggle
in, followed by the reporters, a few spectators and
witnesses, and finally the coroner, who immediately took his
place at the head of the table and prepared to open the
proceedings.</p>

<p>At this moment I observed Miss D’Arblay standing
hesitatingly in the doorway and looking into the room
as if reluctant to enter. I at once rose and went to her,
and as I approached she greeted me with a friendly smile
and held out her hand; and I then perceived, lurking just
outside, a tall, black-apparelled woman, whose face I
recognized as that which I had seen at the window.</p>

<p>“This,” said Miss D’Arblay, presenting me, “is my
friend, Miss Boler, of whom I spoke to you. This,
Arabella dear, is the gentleman who was so kind to me on
that dreadful day.”</p>

<p>I bowed deferentially, and Miss Boler recognized my
existence by a majestic inclination, remarking that she
remembered me. As the coroner now began his
preliminary address to the jury, I hastened to find three
chairs near the table, and, having inducted the ladies into
two of them, took the third myself, next to Miss
D’Arblay. The coroner and the jury now rose and went
out to the adjacent mortuary to view the body, and
during their absence I stole an occasional critical glance at
my fair friend.</p>

<p>Marion D’Arblay was, as I have said, a strikingly
handsome girl. The fact seemed now to dawn on me
afresh, as a new discovery; for the harrowing
circumstances of our former meeting had so preoccupied me
that I had given little attention to her personality. But
now, as I looked her over anxiously to see how the
grievous days had dealt with her, it was with a sort of
surprised admiration that I noted the beautiful,
thoughtful face, the fine features, and the wealth of dark,
gracefully disposed hair. I was relieved, too, to see the change
that a couple of days had wrought. The wild, dazed
look was gone. Though she was pale and heavy-eyed
and looked tired and infinitely sad, her manner was calm,
quiet and perfectly self-possessed.</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” said I, “that this is going to be rather
a painful ordeal for you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she agreed; “it is all very dreadful. But it is
a dreadful thing in any case to be bereft in a moment
of the one whom one loves best in all the world. The
circumstances of the loss cannot make very much
difference. It is the loss itself that matters. The worst
moment was when the blow fell—when we found him.
This inquiry and the funeral are just the drab
accompaniments that bring home the reality of what has
happened.”</p>

<p>“Has the inspector called on you?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied. “He had to, to get the particulars;
and he was so kind and delicate that I am not in
the least afraid of the examination by the coroner.
Every one has been kind to me, but none so kind as you
were on that terrible morning.”</p>

<p>I could not see that I had done anything to call for
so much gratitude, and I was about to enter a modest
disclaimer when the coroner and the jury returned, and
the inspector approached somewhat hurriedly.</p>

<p>“It will be necessary,” said he, “for Miss D’Arblay to
see the body—just to identify deceased; a glance will be
enough. And, as you are a witness, Doctor, you had
better go with her to the mortuary. I will show you
the way.”</p>

<p>Miss D’Arblay rose without any comment or apparent
reluctance, and we followed the inspector to the
adjoining mortuary, where, having admitted us, he stood
outside awaiting us. The body lay on the slate-topped
table, covered with a sheet excepting the face, which was
exposed and was undisfigured by any traces of the
examination. I watched my friend a little nervously as we
entered the grim chamber, fearful that this additional
trial might be too much for her self-control. But she
kept command of herself, though she wept quietly as she
stood beside the table looking down on the still,
waxen-faced figure. After standing thus for a few moments,
she turned away with a smothered sob, wiped her eyes,
and walked out of the mortuary.</p>

<p>When we re-entered the court-room, we found our
chairs moved up to the table, and the coroner waiting to
call the witnesses. As I had expected, my name was
the first on the list, and, on being called, I took my place
by the table near to the coroner and was duly sworn.</p>

<p>“Will you give us your name, occupation, and
address?” the coroner asked.</p>

<p>“My name is Stephen Gray,” I replied. “I am a
medical practitioner, and my temporary address is 61,
Mecklenburgh-square, London.”</p>

<p>“When you say ‘your temporary address’ you
mean⸺?”</p>

<p>“I am taking charge of a medical practice at that
address. I shall be there six weeks or more.”</p>

<p>“Then that will be your address for our purposes.
Have you viewed the body that is now lying in the
mortuary, and, if so, do you recognize it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is the body which I saw lying in a pond in
Church-yard Bottom Wood on the morning of the 16th
instant—last Tuesday.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell us how long deceased had been dead
when you first saw the body?”</p>

<p>“I should say he had been dead nine or ten hours.”</p>

<p>“Will you relate the circumstances under which you
discovered the body?”</p>

<p>I gave a circumstantial account of the manner in which
I made the tragic discovery, to which not only the jury
but also the spectators listened with eager interest. When
I had finished my narrative, the coroner asked: “Did
you observe anything which led you, as a medical man,
to form any opinion as to the cause of death?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied. “I saw no injuries or marks of
violence or anything which was not consistent with death
by drowning.”</p>

<p>This concluded my evidence, and when I had resumed
my seat, the name of Marion D’Arblay was called by
the coroner, who directed that a chair should be placed
for the witness. When she had taken her seat, he conveyed
to her, briefly, but feelingly, his own and the jury’s
sympathy.</p>

<p>“It has been a terrible experience for you,” he said,
“and we are most sorry to have to trouble you in your
great affliction, but you will understand that it is
unavoidable.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand that,” she replied, “and I wish
to thank you and the jury for your kind sympathy.”</p>

<p>She was then sworn, and having given her name and
address, proceeded to answer the questions addressed to
her, which elicited a narrative of the events substantially
identical with that which she had given to the inspector
and which I have already recorded.</p>

<p>“You have told us,” said the coroner, “that when Dr.
Gray spoke to you, you were searching among the bushes.
Will you tell us what was in your mind—what you were
searching for, and what induced you to make that
search?”</p>

<p>“I was very uneasy about my father,” she replied.
“He had not been home that night, and he had not told
me that he intended to stay at the studio—as he
sometimes did when he was working very late. So, in the
morning I went to the studio in Abbey-road to see if he
was there; but the caretaker told me that he had started
for home about ten o’clock. Then I began to fear that
something had happened to him, and as he always came
home by the path through the wood, I went there to see
if—if anything had happened to him.”</p>

<p>“Had you in your mind any definite idea as to what
might have happened to him?”</p>

<p>“I thought he might have been taken ill or have fallen
down dead. He once told me that he would probably
die quite suddenly. I believe that he suffered from some
affection of the heart, but he did not like speaking about
his health.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that there was nothing more than this
in your mind?”</p>

<p>“There was nothing more. I thought that his heart
might have failed and that he might have wandered, in
a half-conscious state, away from the main path and
fallen dead in one of the thickets.”</p>

<p>The coroner pondered this reply for some time. I
could not see why, for it was plain and straightforward
enough. At length he said, very gravely and with what
seemed to me unnecessary emphasis:</p>

<p>“I want you to be quite frank and open with us, Miss
D’Arblay. Can you swear that there was no other
possibility in your mind than that of sudden illness?”</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise, apparently not understanding
the drift of the question. As to me, I assumed
that he was endeavoring delicately to ascertain whether
deceased was addicted to drink.</p>

<p>“I have told you exactly what was in my mind,” she
replied.</p>

<p>“Have you ever had any reason to suppose, or to entertain
the possibility, that your father might take his
own life?”</p>

<p>“Never,” she answered emphatically. “He was a
happy, even-tempered man, always interested in his work,
and always in good spirits. I am sure he would never
have taken his own life.”</p>

<p>The coroner nodded with a rather curious air of
satisfaction, as if he were concurring with the witness’s
statement. Then he asked in the same grave, emphatic
manner:</p>

<p>“So far as you know, had your father any enemies?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied confidently. “He was a kindly,
amiable man who disliked nobody, and every one who knew
him loved him.”</p>

<p>As she uttered this panegyric (and what prouder
testimony could a daughter have given?), her eyes filled,
and the coroner looked at her with deep sympathy but
yet with a somewhat puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“You are sure,” he said gently, “that there was no
one whom he might have injured—even inadvertently—or
who bore him any grudge or ill-will?”</p>

<p>“I am sure,” she answered, “that he never injured
or gave offence to any one, and I do not believe that there
was any person in the whole world who bore him
anything but goodwill.”</p>

<p>The coroner noted this reply, and as he entered it in
the depositions his face bore the same curious puzzled
or doubtful expression. When he had written the
answer down, he asked:</p>

<p>“By the way, what was the deceased’s occupation?”</p>

<p>“He was a sculptor by profession, but in late years he
worked principally as a modeller for various trades—pottery
manufacturers, picture-frame makers, carvers, and
the makers of high-class wax figures for shop windows.”</p>

<p>“Had he any assistants or subordinates?”</p>

<p>“No. He worked alone. Occasionally I helped him
with his moulds when he was very busy or had a very
large work on hand; but usually he did everything
himself. Of course, he occasionally employed models.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who those models were?”</p>

<p>“They were professional models. The men, I think,
were all Italians, and some of the women were too. I
believe my father kept a list of them in his address
book.”</p>

<p>“Was he working from a model on the night of his
death?”</p>

<p>“No. He was making the moulds for a porcelain
statuette.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear that he had any kind of trouble with
his models?”</p>

<p>“Never. He seemed always on the best of terms with
them, and he used to speak of them most appreciatively.”</p>

<p>“What sort of persons are professional models?
Should you say they are a decent, well-conducted class?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They are usually most respectable, hard-working
people; and, of course, they are sober and decent in
their habits or they would be of no use for their
professional duties.”</p>

<p>The coroner meditated on these replies with a
speculative eye on the witness. After a short pause, he began
along another line.</p>

<p>“Did deceased ever carry about with him property of
any considerable value?”</p>

<p>“Never, to my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“No jewellery, plate, or valuable material?”</p>

<p>“No. His work was practically all in plaster or wax.
He did no goldsmith’s work and he used no precious
material.”</p>

<p>“Did he ever have any considerable sums of money
about him?”</p>

<p>“No. He received all his payments by cheque and
he made his payments in the same way. His habit was
to carry very little money on his person—usually not
more than one or two pounds.”</p>

<p>Once more the coroner reflected profoundly. It
seemed to me that he was trying to elicit some fact—I
could not imagine what—and was failing utterly. At
length, after another puzzled look at the witness, he
turned to the jury and inquired if any of them wished to
put any questions; and when they had severally shaken
their heads he thanked Miss D’Arblay for the clear and
straightforward way in which she had given her
evidence and released her.</p>

<p>While the examination had been proceeding, I had
allowed my eyes to wander round the room with some
curiosity: for this was the first time that I had ever been
present at an inquest. From the jury, the witnesses in
waiting and the reporters—among whom I tried to
identify Dr. Thorndyke’s stenographer—my attention was
presently transferred to the spectators. There were only
a few of them, but I found myself wondering why there
should be any. What kind of person attends as a
spectator at an ordinary inquest such as this appeared to be?
The newspaper reports of the finding of the body were
quite unsensational and promised no startling
developments. Finally I decided that they were probably local
residents who had some knowledge of the deceased and
were just indulging their neighbourly curiosity.</p>

<p>Among them my attention was particularly attracted
by a middle-aged woman who sat near me: at least I
judged her to be middle-aged, though the rather dense
black veil that she wore obscured her face to a great
extent. Apparently she was a widow, and advertised the
fact by the orthodox, old-fashioned “weeds.” But I
could see that she had white hair and wore spectacles.
She held a folded newspaper on her knee, apparently
dividing her attention between the printed matter and
the proceedings of the court. She gave me the
impression of having come in to spend an idle hour,
combining a somewhat perfunctory reading of the paper with
a still more perfunctory attention to the rather
gruesome entertainment that the inquest afforded.</p>

<p>The next witness called was the doctor who had made
the official examination of the body; on whom my
bereaved friend bestowed a listless, incurious glance and
then returned to her newspaper. He was a youngish
man, though his hair was turning gray, with a quiet but
firm and confident manner and a very clear, pleasant
voice. The preliminaries having been disposed of, the
coroner led off with the question:</p>

<p>“You have made an examination of the body of the
deceased?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is that of a well-proportioned, fairly
muscular man of about sixty, quite healthy with the exception
of the heart, one of the valves of which—the mitral
valve—was incompetent and allowed some leakage of
blood to take place.”</p>

<p>“Was the heart affection sufficient to account for the
death of deceased?”</p>

<p>“No. It was quite a serviceable heart. There was
good compensation—that is to say, there was extra
growth of muscle to make up for the leaky valve. So
far as his heart was concerned, deceased might have
lived for another twenty years.”</p>

<p>“Were you able to ascertain what actually was the
cause of death?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The cause of death was aconitine poisoning.”</p>

<p>At this reply a murmur of astonishment arose from
the jury, and I heard Miss D’Arblay suddenly draw in
her breath. The spectators sat up on their benches, and
even the veiled lady was so far interested as to look up
from her paper.</p>

<p>“How had the poison been administered?” the
coroner asked.</p>

<p>“It had been injected under the skin by means of a
hypodermic syringe.”</p>

<p>“Can you give an opinion as to whether the poison
was administered to deceased by himself or by some other
person?”</p>

<p>“It could not have been injected by deceased himself,”
the witness replied. “The needle-puncture was in the
back, just below the left shoulder-blade. It is, in my
opinion, physically impossible for any one to inject into
his own body with a hypodermic syringe in that spot.
And, of course, a person who was administering an
injection to himself would select the most convenient
spot—such as the front of the thigh. But apart from the
question of convenience, the place in which the
needle-puncture was found was actually out of reach.” Here
the witness produced a hypodermic syringe, the action
of which he demonstrated with the aid of a glass of
water; and having shown the impossibility of applying
it to the spot that he had described, passed the syringe
round for the jury’s inspection.</p>

<p>“Have you formed any opinion as to the purpose for
which this drug was administered in this manner?”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that it was administered for the
purpose of causing the death of deceased.”</p>

<p>“Might it not have been administered for medicinal
purposes?”</p>

<p>“That is quite inconceivable. Leaving out of
consideration the circumstances—the time and place where
the administration occurred—the dose excludes the
possibility of medicinal purposes. It was a lethal dose.
From the tissues round the needle-puncture we recovered
the twelfth of a grain of aconitine. That alone was more
than enough to cause death. But a quantity of the poison
had been absorbed, as was shown by the fact that we
recovered a recognizable trace from the liver.”</p>

<p>“What is the medicinal dose of aconitine?”</p>

<p>“The maximum medicinal dose is about the four-hundredth
of a grain, and even that is not very safe. As
a matter of fact, aconitine is very seldom used in
medical practice. It is a dangerous drug, and of no particular
value.”</p>

<p>“How much aconitine do you suppose was injected?”</p>

<p>“Not less than the tenth of a grain—that is about
forty times the maximum medicinal dose. Probably
more.”</p>

<p>“There can, I suppose, be no doubt as to the accuracy
of the facts that you have stated—as to the nature and
quantity of the poison?”</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt whatever. The analysis was
made in my presence by Professor Woodford, of St.
Margaret’s Hospital, after I had removed the tissues
from the body in his presence. He has not been called
because, in accordance with the procedure under
Coroner’s Law, I am responsible for the analysis and the
conclusions drawn from it.”</p>

<p>“Taking the medical facts as known to you, are you
able to form an opinion as to what took place when the
poison was administered?”</p>

<p>“That,” the witness replied, “is a matter of inference
or conjecture. I infer that the person who administered
the poison thrust the needle violently into the back of the
deceased, intending to inject the poison into the chest.
Actually, the needle struck a rib and bent up sharply,
so that the contents of the syringe were delivered just
under the skin. Then I take it that the assailant ran
away—probably towards the pond—and deceased pursued
him. Very soon the poison would take effect, and
then deceased would have fallen. He may have fallen
into the pond, or more probably, was thrown in. He
was alive when he fell into the pond, as is proved by the
presence of water in the lungs; but he must then have
been insensible; and in a dying condition, for there was
no water in the stomach, which proves that the
swallowing reflex had already ceased.”</p>

<p>“Your considered opinion, then, based on the medical
facts ascertained by you, is, I understand, that deceased
died from the effects of a poison injected into his body
by some other person with homicidal intent?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that is my considered opinion, and I affirm that
the facts do not admit of any other interpretation.”</p>

<p>The coroner looked towards the jury. “Do any of
you gentlemen wish to ask the witness any questions?”
he inquired; and when the foreman had replied that the
jury were entirely satisfied with the doctor’s
explanations, he thanked the witness, who thereupon retired.
The medical witness was succeeded by the inspector, who
made a short statement respecting the effects found on
the person of deceased. They comprised a small sum of
money—under two pounds—a watch, keys, and other
articles, none of them of any appreciable value, but,
such as they were, furnishing evidence that at least petty
robbery had not been the object of the attack.</p>

<p>When the last witness had been heard, the coroner
glanced at his notes and then proceeded to address the
jury.</p>

<p>“There is little, gentlemen,” he began, “that I need
say to you. The facts are before you, and they seem
to admit of only one interpretation. I remind you that,
by the terms of your oath, your finding must be
‘according to the evidence.’ Now the medical evidence is quite
clear and definite. It is to the effect that deceased met
his death by poison, administered violently by some other
person: that is by homicide. Homicide is the killing of
a human being, and it may or may not be criminal. But
if the homicidal act is done with the intent to kill; if
that intention has been deliberately formed—that is to
say, if the homicidal act has been premeditated; then that
homicide is wilful murder.</p>

<p>“Now the person who killed the deceased came to the
place where the act was done provided with a solution of
a very powerful and uncommon vegetable poison. He
was also provided with a very special appliance—to wit,
a hypodermic syringe—for injecting it into the body.
The fact that he was furnished with the poison and the
appliance creates a strong enough presumption that he
came to this place with the deliberate intention of killing
the deceased. That is to say, this fact constitutes strong
evidence of premeditation.</p>

<p>“As to the motive for this act, we are completely in
the dark; nor have we any evidence pointing to the
identity of the person who committed that act. But a
coroner’s inquest is not necessarily concerned with motives,
nor is it our business to fix the act on any particular
person. We have to find how and by what means the
deceased met his death; and for that purpose we have
clear and sufficient evidence. I need say no more, but
will leave you to agree upon your finding.”</p>

<p>There was a brief interval of silence when the coroner
had finished speaking. The jury whispered together for
a few seconds; then the foreman announced that they
had agreed upon their verdict.</p>

<p>“And what is your decision, gentlemen?” the
coroner asked.</p>

<p>“We find,” was the reply, “that deceased met his death
by wilful murder, committed by some person unknown.”</p>

<p>The coroner bowed. “I am in entire agreement with
you, gentlemen,” said he. “No other verdict was
possible, and I am sure you will join me in the hope that
the wretch who committed this dastardly crime may be
identified and in due course brought to justice.”</p>

<p>This brought the proceedings to an end. As the Court
rose the spectators filed out of the building and the
coroner approached Miss D’Arblay to express once more
his deep sympathy with her in her tragic bereavement. I
stood apart with Miss Boler, whose rugged face was wet
with tears, but set in a grim and wrathful scowl.</p>

<p>“Things have taken a terrible turn,” I ventured to
observe.</p>

<p>She shook her head and uttered a sort of low growl.
“It won’t bear thinking of,” she said gruffly. “There
is no possible retribution that would meet the case. One
has thought that some of the old punishments were cruel
and barbarous, but if I could lay my hands on the villain
that did this⸺” She broke off, leaving the conclusion
to my imagination, and in an extraordinarily different
voice said: “Come, Miss Marion, let us get out of this
awful place.”</p>

<p>As we walked away slowly and in silence, I looked at
Miss D’Arblay, not without anxiety. She was very
pale, and the dazed expression that her face had borne
on the fatal day of the discovery had, to some extent,
reappeared. But now the signs of bewilderment and
grief were mingled with something new. The rigid face,
the compressed lips, and lowered brows spoke of a deep
and abiding wrath.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned to me and said, abruptly, almost
harshly:</p>

<p>“I was wrong in what I said to you before the inquiry.
You remember that I said that the circumstances of the
loss could make no difference; but they make a whole
world of difference. I had supposed that my dear father
had died as he had thought he would die; that it was
the course of Nature, which we cannot rebel against.
Now I know, from what the doctor said, that he might
have lived on happily for the full span of human life but
for the malice of this unknown wretch. His life was
not lost; it was stolen—from him and from me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said somewhat lamely. “It is a horrible
affair.”</p>

<p>“It is beyond bearing!” she exclaimed. “If his death
had been natural, I would have tried to resign myself
to it. I would have tried to put my grief away. But
to think that his happy, useful life has been snatched
from him—that he has been torn from us who loved
him by the deliberate act of this murderer—it is
unendurable. It will be with me every hour of my life
until I die. And every hour I shall call on God for
justice against this wretch.”</p>

<p>I looked at her with a sort of admiring surprise. A
quiet, gentle girl as I believed her to be at ordinary
times, now, with her flushed cheeks, her flashing eyes
and ominous brows, she reminded me of one of the
heroines of the French Revolution. Her grief seemed
to be merged in a longing for vengeance.</p>

<p>While she had been speaking Miss Boler had kept up
a running accompaniment in a deep, humming bass. I
could not catch the words—if there were any—but was
aware only of a low, continuous bourdon. She now said
with grim decision:</p>

<p>“God will not let him escape. He shall pay the debt
to the uttermost farthing.” Then, with sudden fierceness,
she added: “If I should ever meet with him I could
kill him with my own hand.”</p>

<p>After this both women relapsed into silence, which I
was loth to interrupt. The circumstances were too tragic
for conversation. When we reached their gate Miss
D’Arblay held out her hand and once again thanked me
for my help and sympathy.</p>

<p>“I have done nothing,” said I, “that any stranger
would not have done, and I deserve no thanks. But I
should like to think that you will look on me as a friend,
and if you should need any help will let me have the
privilege of being of use to you.”</p>

<p>“I look on you as a friend already,” she replied; “and
I hope you will come and see us sometimes—when we
have settled down to our new conditions of life.”</p>

<p>As Miss Boler seemed to confirm this invitation, I
thanked them both and took my leave, glad to think that
I had now a recognized status as a friend and might
pursue a project which had formed in my mind even
before we had left the court-house.</p>

<p>The evidence of the murder, which had fallen like a
thunderbolt on us all, had a special significance for me;
for I knew that Dr. Thorndyke was behind this discovery,
though to what extent I could not judge. The medical
witness was an obviously capable man, and it might be
that he would have made the discovery without assistance.
But a needle-puncture in the back is a very inconspicuous
thing. Ninety-nine doctors in a hundred would almost
certainly have overlooked it, especially in the case of a
body apparently “found drowned,” and seeming to call
for no special examination beyond the search for gross
injuries. The revelation was very characteristic of
Thorndyke’s methods and principles. It illustrated in a
most striking manner the truth which he was never tired
of insisting on: that it is never safe to accept obvious
appearances, and that every case, no matter how
apparently simple and commonplace, should be approached
with suspicion and scepticism and subjected to the most
rigorous scrutiny. That was precisely what had been
done in this case; and thereby an obvious suicide had
been resolved into a cunningly planned and skilfully
executed murder. It was quite possible that, but for my
visit to Thorndyke, those cunning plans would have
succeeded and the murderer have secured the cover of a
verdict of “Death by misadventure” or “Suicide while
temporarily insane.” At any rate, the results had
justified me in invoking Dr. Thorndyke’s aid; and the
question now arose whether it would be possible to retain
him for the further investigation of the case.</p>

<p>This was the project that had occurred to me as I
listened to the evidence and realized how completely the
unknown murderer had covered up his tracks. But there
were difficulties. Thorndyke might consider such an
investigation outside his province. Again, the costs
involved might be on a scale entirely beyond my means.
The only thing to be done was to call on Thorndyke and
hear what he had to say on the subject, and this I
determined to do on the first opportunity. And having formed
this resolution, I made my way back by the shortest route
to Mecklenburgh-square, where the evening consultations
were now nearly due.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV. <br/> Mr. Bendelow</h2>

<p>There are certain districts in London the appearance
of which conveys to the observer the impression that the
houses, and indeed, the entire streets, have been picked
up second-hand. There is in this aspect a grey, colourless,
mouldy quality, reminiscent, not of the antique shop, but
rather of the marine store dealers; a quality which even
communicates itself to the inhabitants, so that one gathers
the impression that the whole neighbourhood was taken
as a going concern.</p>

<p>It was on such a district that I found myself looking
down from the top of an omnibus a few days after the
inquest (Dr. Cornish’s brougham being at the moment
under repairs and his horse “out to grass” during the
slack season), being bound for a street in the
neighbourhood of Hoxton—Market-street by name—which abutted,
as I had noticed when making out my route, on the
Regent’s Canal. The said route I had written out, and
now, in the intervals of my surveys of the unlovely
prospect, I divided my attention between it and the note
which had summoned me to these remote regions.</p>

<p>Concerning the latter I was somewhat curious, for the
envelope was addressed, not to Dr. Cornish, but to “Dr.
Stephen Gray.” This was really quite an odd
circumstance. Either the writer knew me personally or was
aware that I was acting as locum tenens for Cornish.
But the name—James Morris—was unknown to me, and
a careful inspection of the index of the ledger had failed
to bring to light any one answering to the description.
So Mr. Morris was presumably a stranger to my principal
also. The note, which had been left by hand in the
morning, requested me to call “as early in the forenoon as
possible,” which seemed to hint at some degree of
urgency. Naturally, as a young practitioner, I speculated
with interest, not entirely unmingled with anxiety, on
the possible nature of the case, and also on the patient’s
reasons for selecting a medical attendant whose residence
was so inconveniently far away.</p>

<p>In accordance with my written route, I got off the
omnibus at the corner of Shepherdess-walk, and pursuing
that pastoral thoroughfare for some distance, presently
plunged into a labyrinth of streets adjoining it and
succeeded most effectually in losing myself. However,
inquiries addressed to an intelligent fish-vendor elicited a
most lucid direction and I soon found myself in a little,
drab street which justified its name by giving
accommodation to a row of stationary barrows loaded with
what looked like the “throw-outs” from a colossal spring
clean. Passing along this kerb-side market and reflecting
(like Diogenes, in similar circumstances) how many
things there were in the world that I did not want, I
walked slowly up the street looking for Number 23—my
patient’s number—and the canal which I had seen
on the map. I located them both at the same instant,
for Number 23 turned out to be the last house on the
opposite side, and a few yards beyond it the street was
barred by a low wall, over which, as I looked, the mast
of a sailing-barge came into view and slowly crept past.
I stepped up to the wall and looked over. Immediately
beneath me was the towing-path, alongside which the
barge was now bringing up and beginning to lower her
mast, apparently in order to pass under a bridge that
spanned the canal some two hundred yards farther along.</p>

<p>From these nautical manœuvres I transferred my
attention to my patient’s house—or, at least, so much of it
as I could see; for Number 23 appeared to consist of a
shop with nothing over it. There was, however, in a
wall which extended to the canal wall a side door with
a bell and knocker, so I inferred that the house was behind
the shop, and that the latter had been built on a formerly
existing front garden. The shop itself was somewhat
reminiscent of the stalls down the street, for though the
fascia was newly painted (with the inscription “J. Morris,
General Dealer”) the stock-in-trade exhibited in the
window was in the last stage of senile decay. It included,
I remember, a cracked Toby jug, a mariner’s sextant of
an obsolete type, a Dutch clock without hands, a snuff-box,
one or two plaster statuettes, an invalid punch-bowl,
a shiny, dark, and inscrutable oil painting and a plaster
mask, presumably the death mask of some celebrity whose
face was unknown to me.</p>

<p>My examination of this collection was brought to a
sudden end by the apparition of a face above the
half-blind of glazed shop-door; the face of a middle-aged
woman who seemed to be inspecting me with malevolent
interest. Assuming—rather too late—a brisk, professional
manner, I opened the shop door, thereby setting
a bell jangling within, and confronted the owner of the
face.</p>

<p>“I am Dr. Gray,” I began to explain.</p>

<p>“Side door,” she interrupted brusquely. “Ring the bell
and knock.”</p>

<p>I backed out hastily and proceeded to follow the directions,
giving a tug at the bell and delivering a flourish
on the knocker. The hollow reverberations of the latter
almost suggested an empty house, but my vigorous pull
at the bell-handle produced no audible result, from which
I inferred—wrongly, as afterwards appeared—that it was
out of repair. After waiting quite a considerable time,
I was about to repeat the performance when I heard
sounds within; and then the door was opened, to my
surprise, by the identical sour-faced woman whom I had seen
in the shop. As her appearance and manner did not
invite conversation, and she uttered no word, I followed
her in silence through a long passage, or covered way,
which ran parallel to the side of the shop and presumably
crossed the site of the garden. It ended at a door which
opened into the hall proper; a largish square space into
which the doors of the ground-floor rooms opened. It
contained the main staircase and was closed in at the
farther end by a heavy curtain which extended from wall
to wall.</p>

<p>We proceeded in this funereal manner up the stairs
to the first floor on the landing of which my conductress
halted and for the first time broke the silence.</p>

<p>“You will probably find Mr. Bendelow asleep or
dozing,” she said in a rather gruff voice. “If he is, there is
no need for you to disturb him.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bendelow!” I exclaimed. “I understood that his
name was Morris.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t,” she retorted. “It is Bendelow. My
name is Morris and so is my husband’s. It was he who
wrote to you.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said I, “how did he know my name?
I am acting for Dr. Cornish, you know.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” said she, “and I don’t suppose he did.
Probably the servant told him. But it doesn’t matter.
Here you are, and you will do as well as another. I was
telling you about Mr. Bendelow. He is in a pretty bad
way. The specialist whom Mr. Morris took him to—Dr.
Artemus Cropper—said he had cancer of the bi-lorus,
whatever that is⸺”</p>

<p>“Pylorus,” I corrected.</p>

<p>“Well, pylorus, then, if you prefer it,” she said
impatiently. “At any rate, whatever it is, he’s got cancer
of it; and, as I said before, he is in a pretty bad way.
Dr. Cropper told us what to do, and we are doing it.
He wrote out full directions as to diet—I will show them
to you presently—and he said that Mr. Bendelow was to
have a dose of morphia if he complained of pain—which
he does, of course; and that, as there was no chance of
his getting better, it didn’t matter how much morphia he
had. The great thing was to keep him out of pain. So
we give it to him twice a day—at least, my husband
does—and that keeps him fairly comfortable. In fact,
he sleeps most of the time, and is probably dozing now;
so you are not likely to get much out of him, especially
as he is rather hard of hearing even when he is awake.
And now you had better come in and have a look at him.”</p>

<p>She advanced to the door of a room and opened it
softly, and I followed in a somewhat uncomfortable
frame of mind. It seemed to me that I had no
function but that of a mere figure-head. Dr. Cropper, whom
I knew by name as a physician of some reputation, had
made the diagnosis and prescribed the treatment, neither
of which I, as a mere beginner, would think of contesting.
It was an unsatisfactory, even an ignominious,
position from which my professional pride revolted. But
apparently it had to be accepted.</p>

<p>Mr. Bendelow was a most remarkable-looking man.
Probably he had always been somewhat peculiar in
appearance; but now the frightful emaciation (which
strongly confirmed Cropper’s diagnosis) had so
accentuated his original peculiarities that he had the
appearance of some dreadful, mirthless caricature. Under the
influence of the remorseless disease, every structure which
was capable of shrinking had shrunk to the vanishing-point,
leaving the unshrinkable skeleton jutting out with
a most horrible and grotesque effect. His great hooked
nose, which must always have been strikingly prominent,
stuck out now, thin and sharp, like the beak of some bird
of prey. His heavy, beetling brows, which must always
have given to his face a frowning sullenness, now
overhung sockets which had shrunk away into mere caverns.
His naturally high cheek-bones were now not only
prominent, but exhibited the details of their structure as one
sees them in a dry skull. Altogether, his aspect was at
once pitiable and forbidding. Of his age I could form
no estimate. He might have been a hundred. The
wonder was that he was still alive; that there was yet
left in that shrivelled body enough material to enable
its mechanism to continue its functions.</p>

<p>He was not asleep, but was in that somnolent, lethargic
state that is characteristic of the effects of morphia. He
took no notice of me when I approached the bed, nor even
when I spoke his name somewhat loudly.</p>

<p>“I told you you wouldn’t get much out of him,” said
Mrs. Morris, looking at me with a sort of grim
satisfaction. “He doesn’t have a great deal to say to any of
us nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “there is no need to rouse him, but I
had better just examine him, if only as a matter of form.
I can’t take the case entirely on hearsay.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” she agreed. “You know best. Do
what you think necessary, but don’t disturb him more
than you can help.”</p>

<p>It was not a prolonged examination. The first touch
of my fingers on the shrunken abdomen made me aware
of the unmistakable hard mass and rendered further
exploration needless. There could be no doubt as to the
nature of the case or of what the future held in store.
It was only a question of time, and a short time at that.</p>

<p>The patient submitted to the examination quite
passively, but he seemed to be fully aware of what was going
on, for he looked at me in a sort of drunken, dreamy
fashion, but without any sign of interest in my
proceedings. When I had finished, I looked him over again,
trying to reconstitute him as he might have been before
this deadly disease fastened on him. I observed that he
seemed to have a fair crop of hair of a darkish iron-grey.
I say “seemed,” because the greater part of his head was
covered by a skull cap of black silk; but a fringe of hair
straying from under it on to the forehead suggested that
he was not bald. His teeth, too, which were rather
conspicuous, were natural teeth and in good preservation.
In order to verify this fact, I stooped and raised his lip
the better to examine them. But at this point Mrs.
Morris intervened.</p>

<p>“There, that will do,” she said impatiently. “You are
not a dentist, and his teeth will last as long as he will
want them. If you have finished you had better come
with me and I will show you Dr. Cropper’s prescriptions.
Then you can tell me if you have any further directions
to give.”</p>

<p>She led the way out of the room, and when I had made
a farewell gesture to the patient (of which he took no
notice) I followed her down the stairs to the ground
floor where she ushered me into a small, rather elegantly
furnished room. Here she opened the flap of a bureau
and from one of the little drawers took an open envelope
which she handed to me. It contained one or two
prescriptions for occasional medicines, and a sheet of
directions relative to the diet and general management of the
patient, including the administration of morphia. The
latter read, under the general heading, “Simon Bendelow,
Esq.”:</p>

<p>“As the case progresses, it will probably be necessary
to administer morphine regularly, but the amount given
should, if possible, be restricted to ¼ gr. Morph. Sulph.,
not more than twice a day; but, of course, the hopeless
prognosis and probable early termination of the case make
some latitude admissible.”</p>

<p>Although I was in complete agreement with the writer,
I was a little puzzled by these documents. They were
signed “Artemus Cropper, M.D.,” but they were not
addressed to any person by name. They appeared to have
been given to Mr. Morris, in whose possession they now
were; but the use of the word “morphine” instead of the
more familiar “morphia” and the generally technical
phraseology seemed inappropriate to directions addressed
to lay persons. As I returned them I remarked:</p>

<p>“These directions read as if they had been intended
for the information of a medical man.”</p>

<p>“They were,” she replied. “They were meant for the
doctor who was attending Mr. Bendelow at the time.
When we moved to this place I got them from him to
show to the new doctor. You are the new doctor.”</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t been here very long?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied. “We have only just moved in.
And that reminds me that our stock of morphia is running
out. Could you bring a fresh tube of the tabloids next
time you call? My husband left an empty tube for me
to give you to remind you what size the tabloids are.
He gives Mr. Bendelow the injections.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said I, “but I don’t want the empty tube.
I read the prescription and shan’t forget the dose. I will
bring a new tube to-morrow—that is, if you want me to
call every day. It seems hardly necessary.”</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t,” she agreed. “I should think twice a
week would be quite enough. Monday and Thursday
would suit me best; if you could manage to come about
this time I should be sure to be in. My time is rather
taken up, as I haven’t a servant at present.”</p>

<p>It was a bad arrangement. Fixed appointments are
things to avoid in medical practice. Nevertheless I agreed
to it—subject to unforeseen obstacles—and was
forthwith conducted back along the covered way and launched
into the outer world with a farewell which it would be
inadequate to describe as unemotional.</p>

<p>As I turned away from the door I cast a passing glance
at the shop window; and once again I perceived a face
above the half-blind. It was a man’s face this time;
presumably the face of Mr. Morris. And, like his wife,
he seemed to be “taking stock of me.” I returned the
attention, and carried away with me the instantaneous
mental photograph of a man in that unprepossessing
transitional state between being clean-shaved and wearing
a beard which is characterized by a sort of grubby
prickliness that disfigures the features without obscuring them.
His stubble was barely a week old, but as his complexion
and hair were dark, the effect was very untidy and
disreputable. And yet, as I have said, it did not obscure the
features. I was even able, in that momentary glance, to
note a detail which would probably have escaped a
non-medical eye: the scar of a hare-lip which had been very
neatly and skilfully mended, and which a moustache would
probably have concealed altogether.</p>

<p>I did not, however, give much thought to Mr. Morris.
It was his dour-faced wife, with her gruff, over-bearing
manner who principally occupied my reflections. She
seemed to have divined in some way that I was but a
beginner—perhaps my youthful appearance gave her the
hint—and to have treated me with almost open contempt.
In truth my position was not a very dignified one. The
diagnosis of the case had been made for me, the
treatment had been prescribed for me, and was being carried
out by other hands than mine. My function was to
support a kind of legal fiction that I was conducting the case,
but principally to supply the morphia (which a chemist
might have refused to do), and when the time came, to
sign the death certificate. It was an ignominious rôle
for a young and ambitious practitioner, and my pride was
disposed to boggle at it. But yet there was nothing to
which I could object. The diagnosis was undoubtedly
correct, and the treatment and management of the case
exactly such as I should have prescribed. Finally I
decided that my dissatisfaction was principally due to the
unattractive personality of Mrs. Morris; and with this
conclusion I dismissed the case from my mind and let
my thoughts wander into more agreeable channels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V. <br/> Inspector Follett’s Discovery</h2>

<p>To a man whose mind is working actively, walking
is a more acceptable mode of progression than riding in
a vehicle. There is a sort of reciprocity between the
muscles and the brain—possibly due to the close
association of the motor and psychical centres—whereby the
activity of the one appears to act as a stimulus to the
other. A sharp walk sets the mind working, and,
conversely, a state of lively reflection begets an impulse to
bodily movement.</p>

<p>Hence, when I had emerged from Market-street and
set my face homewards, I let the omnibuses rumble past
unheeded. I knew my way now. I had but to retrace
the route by which I had come, and, preserving my
isolation amidst the changing crowd, let my thoughts keep
pace with my feet. And I had, in fact, a good deal to
think about; a general subject for reflection which
arranged itself around two personalities, Miss D’Arblay and
Dr. Thorndyke.</p>

<p>To the former I had written suggesting a call on her,
“subject to the exigencies of the service,” on Sunday
afternoon, and had received a short but cordial note
definitely inviting me to tea. So that matter was settled,
and really required no further consideration, though it
did actually occupy my thoughts for an appreciable part
of my walk. But that was mere self-indulgence: the
preliminary savouring of an anticipated pleasure. My
cogitations respecting Dr. Thorndyke were, on the other hand,
somewhat troubled. I was eager to invoke his aid in
solving the hideous mystery which his acuteness had (I
felt convinced) brought into view. But it would
probably be a costly business, and my pecuniary resources
were not great. To apply to him for services of which I
could not meet the cost was not to be thought of. The
too-common meanness of sponging on a professional man
was totally abhorrent to me.</p>

<p>But what was the alternative? The murder of Julius
D’Arblay was one of those crimes which offer the police
no opportunity; at least, so it seemed to me. Out of the
darkness this fiend had stolen to commit this unspeakable
atrocity, and into the darkness he had straightway
vanished, leaving no trace of his identity nor any hint of his
diabolical motive. It might well be that he had vanished
for ever; that the mystery of the crime was beyond
solution. But if any solution was possible, the one man who
seemed capable of discovering it was John Thorndyke.</p>

<p>This conclusion, to which my reflections led again and
again, committed me to the dilemma that either this
villain must be allowed to go his way unmolested, if the
police could find no clue to his identity—a position that
I utterly refused to accept; or that the one supremely
skilful investigator should be induced, if possible, to
take up the inquiry. In the end I decided to call on
Thorndyke and frankly lay the facts before him, but to
postpone the interview until I had seen Miss D’Arblay
and ascertained what view the police took of the case,
and whether any new facts had transpired.</p>

<p>The train of reflection which brought me to this
conclusion had brought me also, by way of Pentonville, to
the more familiar neighbourhood of Clerkenwell, and I
had just turned into a somewhat squalid by-street, which
seemed to bear in the right direction, when my attention
was arrested by a brass plate affixed to the door of one
of those hybrid establishments, intermediate between a
shop and a private house, known by the generic name of
“Open Surgery.” The name upon the plate—“Dr.
Solomon Usher”—awakened certain reminiscences. In my
freshman days there had been a student of that name at
our hospital; a middle-aged man (elderly, we considered
him, seeing that he was near upon forty), who, after
years of servitude as an unqualified assistant, had scraped
together the means of completing his curriculum. I
remembered him very well: a facetious, seedy, slightly
bibulous but entirely good-natured man, invincibly amiable
(as he had need to be), and always in the best of spirits.
I recalled the quaint figure that furnished such rich
material for our schoolboy wit; the solemn spectacles, the
ridiculous side-whiskers, the chimney-pot hat, the formal
frock-coat (too often decorated with a label secretly
pinned to the coat-tail, and bearing some such inscription
as “This style 10/6,” or other scintillations of freshman
humour), and, looking over the establishment, decided
that it seemed to present a complete congruity with that
well-remembered personality. But the identification was
not left to mere surmise, for even as my eye roamed along
a range of stoppered bottles that peeped over the wire
blind, the door opened and there he was, spectacles,
side-whiskers, top-hat, and frock-coat, all complete, plus an
œdematous-looking umbrella.</p>

<p>He did not recognize me at first—naturally, for I had
changed a good deal more than he had in the five or six
years that had slipped away—but inquired gravely if I
wished to see him. I replied that it had been the dearest
wish of my heart, now at length gratified. Then, as I
grinned in his face, my identity suddenly dawned on him.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Gray!” he exclaimed, seizing my hand.
“God bless me, what a surprise! I didn’t know you.
Getting quite a man. Well, I am delighted to see you.
Come in and have a drink.”</p>

<p>He held the door open invitingly, but I shook my head.</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” I replied. “Not at this time in the
day.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” he urged. “Do you good. I’ve just had
one myself. Can’t say more than that, excepting that I
am ready to have another. Won’t you really? Pity.
Should never waste an opportunity. Which way are you
going?”</p>

<p>It seemed that we were going the same way for some
distance and we accordingly set off together.</p>

<p>“So you’ve flopped out of the nest,” he remarked,
looking me over, “at least so I judge by the adult clothes
that you are wearing. Are you in practice in these
parts?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, “I am doing a locum. Only just
qualified, you know.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said he. “A locum’s the way to begin. Try
your ’prentice hand on somebody else’s patients and pick
up the art of general practice, which they don’t teach you
at the hospital.”</p>

<p>“You mean bookkeeping and dispensing and the
general routine of the day’s work?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” he replied. “I mean practice; the art
of pleasing your patients and keeping your end up.
You’ve got a lot to learn, my boy. Experientia does it.
Scientific stuff is all very well at the hospital, but in
practice it is experience, gumption, tact, knowledge of
human nature, that counts.”</p>

<p>“I suppose a little knowledge of diagnosis and
treatment is useful?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“For your own satisfaction, yes,” he admitted, “but
for practical purposes a little knowledge of men and
women is a good deal better. It isn’t your scientific
learning that brings you kudos, nor is it out-of-the-way
cases. It is just common sense brought to bear on
common ailments. Take the case of an aurist. You think
that he lives by dealing with obscure and difficult middle
and internal ear cases. Nothing of the kind. He lives on
wax. Wax is the foundation of his practice. Patient
comes to him as deaf as a post. He does all the proper
jugglery—tuning-fork, otoscope, speculum, and so on,
for the moral effect. Then he hikes out a good old plug
of cerumen, and the patient hears perfectly. Of course,
he is delighted. Thinks a miracle has been performed.
Goes away convinced that the aurist is a genius; and so
he is if he has managed the case properly. I made my
reputation here on a fish-bone.”</p>

<p>“Well, a fish-bone isn’t always so very easy to extract,”
said I.</p>

<p>“It isn’t,” he agreed. “Especially if it isn’t there.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you about it,” he replied. “A chappie here
got a fish-bone stuck in his throat. Of course, it didn’t
stay there. They never do. But the prick in his soft
palate did, and he was convinced that the bone was still
there. So he sent for a doctor. Doctor came, looked
in his throat. Couldn’t see any fish-bone, and, like a fool,
said so. Tried to persuade the patient that there was no
bone there. But the chappie said it was his throat and he
knew better. He could feel it there. So he sent for
another doctor and the same thing happened. No go.
He had four different doctors and they hadn’t the sense
of an infant among them. Then he sent for me.</p>

<p>“Now, as soon as I heard how the land lay, I nipped
into the surgery and got a fish-bone that I keep there in
a pill-box for emergencies, stuck it into the jaws of a pair
of throat forceps, and off I went. ‘Show me
whereabouts it is,’ says I, handing him a probe to point with.
He showed me the spot and nearly swallowed the probe.
‘All right,’ said I. ‘I can see it. Just shut your eyes and
open your mouth wide and I will have it out in a jiffy.’
I popped the forceps into his mouth, gave a gentle prod
with the point on the soft palate; patient hollered out,
‘Hoo!’ I whisked out the forceps and held them up
before his eyes with the fish-bone grasped in their jaws.</p>

<p>“ ‘Ha!’ says he. ‘Thank Gawd! What a relief! I
can swallow quite well now.’ And so he could. It was
a case of suggestion and counter-suggestion. Imaginary
fish-bone cured by imaginary extraction. And it made my
local reputation. Well, good-bye, old chap. I’ve got a
visit to make here. Come in one evening and smoke a
pipe with me. You know where to find me. And take
my advice to heart. Never go to extract a fish-bone
without one in your pocket; and it isn’t a bad thing to keep
a dried earwig by you. I do. People will persist in
thinking they’ve got one in their ears. So long. Look
me up soon,” and with a farewell flourish of the umbrella,
he turned to a shabby street door and began to work the
top bell-pull as if it were the handle of an air-pump.</p>

<p>I went on my way, not a little amused by my friend’s
genial cynicism, nor entirely uninstructed. For “there is
a soul of truth in things erroneous,” as the philosopher
reminds us; and if the precepts of Solomon Usher did not
sound the highest note of professional ethics, they were
based on a very solid foundation of worldly wisdom.</p>

<p>When, having finished my short round of visits, I
arrived at my temporary home, I was informed by the
housemaid in a mysterious whisper that a police officer
was waiting to see me. “Name of Follett,” she added.
“He’s waiting in the consulting-room.”</p>

<p>Proceeding thither, I found my friend, the Highgate
inspector, with one eye closed, standing before a card
of test-types that hung on the wall. We greeted one
another cordially and then, as I looked at him
inquiringly, he produced from his pocket without remark an
official envelope from which he extracted a coin, a silver
pencil-case and a button. These objects he laid on the
writing-table and silently directed my attention to them.
A little puzzled by his manner I picked up the coin and
examined it attentively. It was a Charles the Second
guinea dated 1663, very clean and bright and in
remarkably perfect preservation. But I could not see that it was
any concern of mine.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful coin,” I remarked; “but what
about it?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t belong to you, then?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. I wish it did.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen it before?”</p>

<p>“Never, to my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“What about the pencil-case?”</p>

<p>I picked it up and turned it over in my fingers. “No,”
I said; “it is not mine and I have no recollection of ever
having seen it before.”</p>

<p>“And the button?”</p>

<p>“It is apparently a waistcoat button,” I said after
having inspected it, “apparently belonging to a tweed
waistcoat; and judging by the appearance of the thread
and the wisp of cloth that it still holds, it must have been
pulled off with some violence. But it isn’t off my
waist-coat, if that is what you want to know.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t much think it was,” he replied, “but I thought
it best to make sure. And it didn’t come from poor Mr.
D’Arblay’s waistcoat, because I have examined that and
there is no button missing. I showed these things to Miss
D’Arblay, and she is sure that none of them belonged to
her father. He never used a pencil-case—artists don’t,
as a rule—and as to the guinea, she knew nothing about
it. If it was her father’s, he must have come by it
immediately before his death; otherwise she felt sure
he would have shown it to her, seeing that they were
both interested in anything in the nature of sculpture.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get these things?” I asked.</p>

<p>“From the pond in the wood,” he replied. “I will tell
you how I came to find them—that is, if I am not taking
up too much of your time.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I assured him; and even as I spoke I
thought of Solomon Usher. He wouldn’t have said that.
He would have anxiously consulted his engagement-book
to see how many minutes he could spare. However,
Inspector Follett was not a patient, and I wanted to hear his
story. So having established him in the easy-chair, I sat
down to listen.</p>

<p>“The morning after the inquest,” he began, “an officer
of the C.I.D. came up to get particulars of the case and
see what was to be done. Well, as soon as I had told
him all I knew and shown him our copy of the
depositions, it was pretty clear to me that he didn’t think there
was anything to be done but wait for some fresh evidence.
Mind you, Doctor, this is in strict confidence.”</p>

<p>“I understand that. But if the Criminal Investigation
Department doesn’t investigate crime, what the deuce is
the good of it?”</p>

<p>“That is hardly a fair way of putting it,” he protested.
“The people at Scotland Yard have got their hands pretty
full, and they can’t spend their time in speculating about
cases in which there is no evidence. They can’t create
evidence; and you can see for yourself that there isn’t
the ghost of a clue to the identity of the man who
committed this murder. But they are keeping the case in
mind, and meanwhile we have got to report any new
facts that may turn up. Those were our instructions,
and when I heard them I decided to do a bit of
investigating on my own, with the Superintendent’s permission,
of course.</p>

<p>“Well, I began by searching the wood thoroughly, but
I got nothing out of that excepting Mr. D’Arblay’s hat,
which I found in the undergrowth not far from the main
path.</p>

<p>“Then I thought of dragging the pond; but I decided
that, as it was only a small pond and shallow, it would
be best to empty it and expose the bottom completely. So
I dammed up the little stream that feeds it, and deepened
the outflow, and very soon I had it quite empty excepting
a few small puddles. And I think it was well worth the
trouble. These things don’t tell us much, but they may
be useful one day for identification. And they do tell us
something. They suggest that this man was a collector
of coins; and they make it fairly clear that there was a
struggle in the pond before Mr. D’Arblay fell down.”</p>

<p>“That is, assuming that the things belonged to the
murderer,” I interposed. “There is no evidence that they
did.”</p>

<p>“No, there isn’t,” he admitted; “but if you consider
the three things together they suggest a very strong
probability. Here is a waistcoat button violently pulled off,
and here are two things such as would be carried in a
waistcoat pocket and might fall out if the waistcoat were
dragged at violently when the wearer was stooping over
a fallen man and struggling to avoid being pulled down
with him. And then there is this coin. Its face value
is a guinea, but it must be worth a good deal more than
that. Do you suppose anybody would leave a thing of
that kind in a shallow pond, from which it could be easily
recovered with a common landing-net? Why, it would
have paid to have had the pond dragged or even emptied.
But, as I say, that wouldn’t have been necessary.”</p>

<p>“I am inclined to think you are right, Inspector,” said
I, rather impressed by the way in which he had reasoned
the matter out; “but even so, it doesn’t seem to me that
we are much more forward. The things don’t point to
any particular person.”</p>

<p>“Not at present,” he rejoined. “But a fact is a fact,
and you can never tell in advance what you may get out
of it. If we should get a hint of any other kind pointing
to some particular person, these things might furnish
invaluable evidence connecting that person with the crime.
They may even give a clue now to the people at the
C.I.D., though that isn’t very likely.”</p>

<p>“Then you are going to hand them over to the Scotland
Yard people?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. The C.I.D. are the lions, you know. I’m
only a jackal.”</p>

<p>I was rather sorry to hear this, for the idea had floated
into my mind that I should have liked Thorndyke to see
these waifs, which, could they have spoken, would have
had so much to tell. To me they conveyed nothing that
threw any light on the ghastly events of that night of
horror. But to my teacher, with his vast experience and
his wonderful power of analyzing evidence they might
convey some quite important significance.</p>

<p>I reflected rapidly on the matter. It would not be wise
to say anything to the inspector about Thorndyke, and it
was quite certain that a loan of the articles would not be
entertained. Probably a description of them would be
enough for the purpose; but still I had a feeling that an
inspection of them would be better. Suddenly I had a
bright idea, and proceeded cautiously to broach it.</p>

<p>“I should rather like to have a record of these things,”
said I; “particularly of the coin. Would you object to
my taking an impression of it in sealing-wax?”</p>

<p>Inspector Follett looked doubtful. “It would be a bit
irregular,” he said. “It is a bit irregular for me to have
shown it to you, but you are interested in the case, and
you are a responsible person. What did you want the
impression for?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “we don’t know much about that coin.
I thought I might be able to pick up some further
information. Of course, I understand that what you have told
me is strictly confidential. I shouldn’t go showing the
thing about, or talking. But I should like to have the
impression to refer to if necessary.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said he. “On that understanding, I have
no objection. But see that you don’t leave any wax on
the coin, or the C.I.D. people will be asking questions.”</p>

<p>With this permission, I set about the business
gleefully, determined to get as good an impression as possible.
From the surgery I fetched an ointment slab, a spirit
lamp, a stick of sealing-wax, a teaspoon, some
powder-papers, a bowl of water, and a jar of vaseline. Laying
a paper on the slab, I put the coin on it and traced its
outline with a pencil. Then I broke off a piece of sealing-wax,
melted it in the teaspoon, and poured it out carefully
into the marked circle so that it formed a round, convex
button of the right size. While the wax was cooling to
the proper consistency, I smeared the coin with vaseline,
and wiped the excess off with my handkerchief. Then
I carefully laid it on the stiffening wax and made steady
pressure. After a few moments I cautiously lifted the
paper and dropped it into the water, leaving it to cool
completely. When, finally, I turned it over under water,
the coin dropped away by its own weight.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful impression,” the inspector remarked,
as he examined it with the aid of my pocket lens, while
I prepared to operate on the reverse of the coin. “As
good as the original. You seem rather a dab at this
sort of thing, Doctor. I wonder if you would mind doing
another pair for me?”</p>

<p>Of course, I complied gladly; and when the inspector
departed a few minutes later he took with him a couple
of excellent wax impressions to console him for the
necessity of parting with the original.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone I proceeded to execute a plan
that had already formed in my mind. First I packed the
two wax impressions very carefully in lint and bestowed
them in a tin tobacco-box, which I made up into a neat
parcel and addressed it to Dr. Thorndyke. Then I wrote
him a short letter giving him the substance of my talk
with Inspector Follett and asking for an appointment
early in the following week to discuss the situation with
him. I did not suppose that the wax impressions would
convey, even to him, anything that would throw fresh
light on this extraordinarily obscure crime. But one
never knew. And the mere finding of the coin might
suggest to him some significance that I had overlooked.
In any case, the new incident gave me an excuse for
reopening the matter with him.</p>

<p>I did not trust the precious missives to the maid, but
as soon as the letter was written I took it and the parcel
in my own hands to the post, dropping the letter into
the box but giving the parcel the added security of
registration. This business being thus despatched, my mind
was free to occupy itself with pleasurable anticipations
of the projected visit to Highgate on the morrow and to
deal with whatever exigencies might arise in the course
of the Saturday evening consultations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI. <br/> Marion D’Arblay at Home</h2>

<p>Most of us have, I imagine, been conscious at times of
certain misgivings as to whether the Progress of which
we hear so much has done for us all that it is assumed
to have done; whether the undoubted gain of advancing
knowledge has not a somewhat heavy counterpoise of
loss. We moderns are accustomed to look upon a world
filled with objects that would have made our forefathers
gasp with admiring astonishment; and we are accordingly
a little puffed up by our superiority. But the museums
and galleries and ancient buildings sometimes tell a
different tale. By them we are made aware that these same
“rude forefathers” were endowed with certain powers
and aptitudes that seem to be denied to the present
generation.</p>

<p>Some such reflections as these passed through my mind
as I sauntered about the ancient village of Highgate,
having arrived in the neighbourhood nearly an hour too
early. Very delightful the old village was to look upon,
and so it had been, even when the mellow red brick was
new and the plaster on the timber houses was but freshly
laid; when the great elms were saplings and the
stage-wagon with its procession of horses rumbled along the
road which now resounds to the thunder of the electric
tram. It was not Time that had made beautiful its
charming old houses and pleasant streets and closes, but
fine workmanship guided by unerring taste.</p>

<p>At four o’clock precisely, by the chime of the church
clock, I pushed open the gate of Ivy Cottage, and as I
walked up the flagged path, read the date, 1709, on a
stone tablet let into the brickwork. I had no occasion
to knock, for my approach had been observed, and as I
mounted the threshold the door opened and Miss
D’Arblay stood in the opening.</p>

<p>“Miss Boler saw you coming up the Grove,” she
explained, as we shook hands. “It is surprising how much
of the outer world you can see from a bay window. It
is as good as a watch tower.” She disposed of my hat
and stick, and then preceded me into the room to which
the window appertained, where, beside a bright fire, Miss
Boler was at the moment occupied with a brilliantly
burnished copper kettle and a silver teapot. She greeted
me with an affable smile, and as much of a bow as was
possible under the circumstances, and then proceeded to
make the tea with an expression of deep concentration.</p>

<p>“I do like punctual people,” she remarked, placing the
teapot on a carved wooden stand. “You know where
you are with them. At the very moment when you
turned the corner, Sir, Miss Marion finished buttering
the last muffin and the kettle boiled over. So you won’t
have to wait a moment.”</p>

<p>Miss D’Arblay laughed softly. “You speak as if Dr.
Gray had staggered into the house in a famished
condition, roaring for food,” said she.</p>

<p>“Well,” retorted Miss Boler, “you said ‘tea at four
o’clock,’ and at four o’clock the tea was ready and Dr.
Gray was here. If he hadn’t been he would have had to
eat leathery muffins, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Horrible!” exclaimed Miss D’Arblay. “One doesn’t
like to think of it; and there is no need to, as it hasn’t
happened. Remember that this is a gate-legged table,
Dr. Gray, when you sit down. They are delightfully
picturesque, but exceedingly bad for the knees of the
unwary.”</p>

<p>I thanked her for the warning, and took my seat with
due caution. Then Miss Boler poured out the tea and
uncovered the muffins with the grave and attentive air
of one performing some ceremonial rite.</p>

<p>As the homely, simple meal proceeded, to an accompaniment
of desultory conversation on every-day topics,
I found myself looking at the two women with a certain
ill-defined surprise. Both were garbed in unobtrusive
black, and both, in moments of repose, looked somewhat
tired and worn. But in their manner and the subjects
of their conversation, they were astonishingly ordinary
and normal. No stranger, looking at them and
listening to their talk, would have dreamed of the tragedy that
overshadowed their lives. But so it constantly happens.
We go into a house of mourning, and are almost
scandalized by its cheerfulness, forgetting that whereas
to us the bereavement is the one salient fact, to the
bereaved there is the necessity of taking up afresh the
threads of their lives. Food must be prepared even while
the corpse lies under the roof, and the common daily
round of duty stands still for no human affliction.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, in the pauses of the conversation,
when their faces were in repose, both women looked
strained and tired. Especially was this so in the case of
Miss D’Arblay. She was not only pale, but she had a
nervous, shaken manner which I did not like. And as
I looked anxiously at the delicate, pallid face, I noticed,
not for the first time, several linear scratches on the cheek
and a small cut on the temple.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing to yourself?” I asked.
“You look as if you had had a fall.”</p>

<p>“She has,” said Miss Boler in an indignant tone. “It
is a marvel that she is here to tell the tale. The wretches!”</p>

<p>I looked at Miss D’Arblay in consternation. “What
wretches?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Ah! indeed!” growled Miss Boler. “I wish I knew.
Tell him about it, Miss Marion.”</p>

<p>“It was really rather a terrifying experience,” said
Miss D’Arblay; “and most mysterious. You know
Southwood Lane and the long, steep hill at the bottom
of it?” I nodded, and she continued: “I have been going
down to the studio every day on my bicycle, just to tidy
up, and, of course, I went by Southwood Lane. It is
really the only way. But I always put on the brake at
the top of the hill and go down quite slowly because
of the crossroads at the bottom. Well, three days ago I
started as usual and ran down the Lane pretty fast until
I got on the hill. Then I put on the brake; and I could
feel at once that it wasn’t working.”</p>

<p>“Has your bicycle only one brake?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It had. I am having a second one fixed now. Well,
when I found that the brake wasn’t acting, I was terrified.
I was already going too fast to jump off, and the speed
increased every moment. I simply flew down the hill,
faster and faster with the wind whistling about my ears
and the trees and the houses whirling past like express
trains. Of course, I could do nothing but steer straight
down the hill; but at the bottom there was the Archway
Road with the trams and ’buses and wagons. I knew
that if a tram crossed the bottom of the Lane as I reached
the road, it was practically certain death. I was horribly
frightened.</p>

<p>“However, mercifully the Archway Road was clear
when I flew across it, and I steered to run on down
Muswell Hill Road, which is nearly in a line with the
lane. But suddenly I saw a steam roller and a heavy
cart, side by side and taking up the whole of the road.
There was no room to pass. The only possible thing
was to swerve round, if I could, into Wood-lane. And
I just managed it. But Wood-lane is pretty steep, and
I flew down it faster than ever. That nearly broke down
my nerve; for at the bottom of the lane is the wood—the
horrible wood that I can never even think of without
a shudder. And there I seemed to be rushing towards
it to my death.”</p>

<p>She paused and drew a deep breath, and her hand
shook so that the cup which it held rattled in the saucer.</p>

<p>“Well,” she continued, “down the Lane I flew with my
heart in my mouth and the entrance to the wood rushing
to meet me. I could see that the opening in the hurdles
was just wide enough for me to pass through, and I
steered for it. I whizzed through into the wood and the
bicycle went bounding down the steep, rough path at a
fearful pace until it came to a sharp turn; and then I
don’t quite know what happened. There was a crash of
snapping branches and a violent shock, but I must have
been partly stunned, for the next thing that I remember
is opening my eyes and looking stupidly at a lady who
was stooping over me. She had seen me fly down the
Lane, and had followed me into the wood to see what
happened to me. She lived in the Lane, and she very
kindly took me to her house and cared for me until I was
quite recovered; and then she saw me home and wheeled
the bicycle.”</p>

<p>“It is a wonder you were not killed outright!” I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she agreed; “it was a narrow escape. But the
odd thing is that, with the exception of these scratches
and a few slight bruises, I was not hurt at all; only very
much shaken. And the bicycle was not damaged a bit.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said I, “what had happened to the
brake?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Miss Boler; “there you are. The
villains!”</p>

<p>Miss D’Arblay laughed softly. “Ferocious Arabella!”
said she. “But it is really a most mysterious affair.
Naturally, I thought that the wire of the brake had
snapped. But it hadn’t. It had been cut.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure of that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, there is no doubt at all,” she replied. “The man
at the repair shop showed it to me. It wasn’t merely
cut in one place. A length of it had been cut right out.
And I can tell within a few minutes when it was done,
for I had been riding the machine in the morning and I
know the brake was all right then. But I left it for a
few minutes outside the gate while I went into the house
to change my shoes, and when I came out, I started on
my adventurous journey. In those few minutes some one
must have come along and just snipped the wire through
in two places and taken away the piece.”</p>

<p>“Scoundrel!” muttered Miss Boler; and I agreed with
her most cordially.</p>

<p>“It was an infamous thing to do,” I exclaimed, “and
the act of an abject fool. I suppose you have no idea
or suspicion as to who the idiot might be?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest,” Miss D’Arblay replied. “I can’t
even guess at the kind of person who would do such a
thing. Boys are sometimes very mischievous, but this
is hardly like a boy’s mischief.”</p>

<p>“No,” I agreed, “it is more like the mischief of a
mentally defective adult; the sort of half-baked larrykin
who sets fire to a rick if he gets the chance.”</p>

<p>Miss Boler sniffed. “Looks to me more like deliberate
malice,” said she.</p>

<p>“Mischievous acts usually do,” I rejoined; “but yet
they are mostly the outcome of stupidity that is indifferent
to consequences.”</p>

<p>“And it is of no use arguing about it,” said Miss
D’Arblay, “because we don’t know who did it or why
he did it, and we have no means of finding out. But I
shall have two brakes in future, and I shall test them
both every time I take the machine out.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will,” said Miss Boler; and this closed
the topic so far as conversation went, though I suspect
that, in the interval of silence that followed, we all
continued to pursue it in our thoughts. And to all of
us, doubtless, the mention of Church-yard Bottom Wood
had awakened memories of that fatal morning when the
pool gave up its dead. No reference to the tragedy had
yet been made, but it was inevitable that the thoughts
which were at the back of all our minds should sooner
or later come to the surface. They were, in fact, brought
there by me, though unintentionally; for, as I sat at the
table, my eyes had strayed more than once to a bust—or
rather a head, for there were no shoulders—which
occupied the centre of the mantelpiece. It was apparently of
lead, and was a portrait, and a very good one, of Miss
D’Arblay’s father. At the first glance I had recognized
the face which I had first seen through the water of the
pool. Miss D’Arblay, who was sitting facing it, caught
my glance, and said: “You are looking at that head of
my dear father. I suppose you recognized it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, instantly. I should take it to be an excellent
likeness.”</p>

<p>“It is,” she replied; “and that is something of an
achievement in a self-portrait in the round.”</p>

<p>“Then he modelled it himself?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with the aid of one or two photographs and a
couple of mirrors. I helped him by taking the dimensions
with callipers and drawing out a scale. Then he made
a wax cast and a fireproof mould, and we cast it together
in type-metal, as we had no means of melting bronze.
Poor Daddy! How proud he was when we broke away
the mould and found the casting quite perfect!”</p>

<p>She sighed as she gazed fondly on the beloved features,
and her eyes filled. Then, after a brief silence, she turned
to me and asked:</p>

<p>“Did Inspector Follett call on you? He said he was
going to.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he called yesterday to show me the things that he
had found in the pond. Of course, they were not mine,
and he seemed to have no doubt—and I think he is
right—that they belonged to the—to the⸺”</p>

<p>“Murderer,” said Miss Boler.</p>

<p>“Yes. He seemed to think that they might furnish
some kind of clue, but I am afraid he had nothing very
clear in his mind. I suppose that coin suggested nothing
to you?”</p>

<p>Miss D’Arblay shook her head. “Nothing,” she
replied. “As it is an ancient coin, the man may be a
collector or a dealer⸺”</p>

<p>“Or a forger,” interposed Miss Boler.</p>

<p>“Or a forger. But no such person is known to us.
And even that is mere guesswork.”</p>

<p>“Your father was not interested in coins, then?”</p>

<p>“As a sculptor, yes, and more especially in medals and
plaquettes. But not as a collector. He had no desire
to possess; only to create. And so far as I know, he
was not acquainted with any collectors. So this
discovery of the inspector’s, so far from solving the
mystery, only adds a fresh problem.”</p>

<p>She reflected for a few moments with knitted brows;
then, turning to me quickly, she asked:</p>

<p>“Did the inspector take you into his confidence at all?
He was very reticent to me, though most kind and
sympathetic. But do you think that he, or the others, are
taking any active measures?”</p>

<p>“My impression,” I answered reluctantly, “is that the
police are not in a position to do anything. The truth
is that this villain seems to have got away without
leaving a trace.”</p>

<p>“That is what I feared,” she sighed. Then with
sudden passion, though in a quiet, suppressed voice, she
exclaimed: “But he must not escape! It would be too
hideous an injustice. Nothing can bring back my dear
father from the grave; but if there is a God of Justice,
this murderous wretch must be called to account and
made to pay the penalty of his crime.”</p>

<p>“He must,” Miss Boler assented in deep, ominous tones,
“and he shall; though God knows how it is to be done.”</p>

<p>“For the present,” said I, “there is nothing to be done
but to wait and see if the police are able to obtain any
fresh information; and meanwhile to turn over every
circumstance that you can think of; to recall the way your
father spent his time, the people he knew, and the
possibility in each case that some cause of enmity may have
arisen.”</p>

<p>“That is what I have done,” said Miss D’Arblay.
“Every night I lie awake, thinking, thinking; but nothing
comes of it. The thing is incomprehensible. This man
must have been a deadly enemy of my father’s. He must
have hated him with the most intense hatred, or he must
have had some strong reason other than mere hatred for
making away with him. But I cannot imagine any person
hating my father, and I certainly have no knowledge of
any such person, nor can I conceive of any reason that
any human creature could have had for wishing for my
father’s death. I cannot begin to understand the meaning
of what has happened.”</p>

<p>“But yet,” said I, “there must be a meaning. This
man—unless he was a lunatic, which he apparently was
not—must have had a motive for committing the murder.
That motive must have had some background, some
connexion with circumstances of which somebody has
knowledge. Sooner or later those circumstances will almost
certainly come to light, and then the motive for the
murder will come into view. But once the motive is
known, it should not be difficult to discover who could
be influenced by such a motive. Let us, for the present,
be patient and see how events shape, but let us also keep
a constant watch for any glimmer of light, for any fact
that may bear on either the motive or the person.”</p>

<p>The two women looked at me earnestly and with an
expression of respectful confidence, of which I knew
myself to be wholly undeserving.</p>

<p>“It gives me new courage,” said Miss D’Arblay, “to
hear you speak in that reasonable, confident tone. I was
in despair, but I feel that you are right. There must
be some explanation of this awful thing; and if there is,
it must be possible to discover it. But we ought not to
put the burden of our troubles on you, though you have
been so kind.”</p>

<p>“You have done me the honour,” said I, “to allow me
to consider myself your friend. Surely friends should
help to bear one another’s burdens.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “in reason; and you have given
most generous help already. But we must not put too
much on you. When my father was alive, he was my
great interest and chief concern. Now that he is gone,
the great purpose of my life is to find the wretch who
murdered him and to see that justice is done. That is all
that seems to matter to me. But it is my own affair. I
ought not to involve my friends in it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t admit that,” said I. “The foundation of
friendship is sympathy and service. If I am your friend,
then what matters to you matters to me; and I may say
that in the very moment when I first knew that your
father had been murdered, I made the resolve to devote
myself to the discovery and punishment of his murderer
by any means that lay in my power. So you must count
me as your ally as well as your friend.”</p>

<p>As I made this declaration—to an accompaniment of
approving growls from Miss Boler—Marion D’Arblay
gave me one quick glance and then looked down; and
once more, her eyes filled. For a few moments she made
no reply; and when, at length, she spoke, her voice
trembled.</p>

<p>“You leave me nothing to say,” she murmured, “but
to thank you from my heart. But you little know what
it means to us, who felt so helpless, to know that we have
a friend so much wiser and stronger than ourselves.”</p>

<p>I was a little abashed, knowing my own weakness and
helplessness, to find her putting so much reliance on me.
However, there was Thorndyke in the background; and
now I was resolved that, if the thing was in any way
to be compassed, his help must be secured without delay.</p>

<p>A longish pause followed, and as it seemed to me that
there was nothing more to say on this subject until I
had seen Thorndyke, I ventured to open a fresh topic.</p>

<p>“What will happen to your father’s practice?” I asked.
“Will you be able to get any one to carry it on for you?”</p>

<p>“I am glad you asked that,” said Miss D’Arblay,
“because, now that you are our counsellor we can take your
opinion, I have already talked the matter over with
Arabella—with Miss Boler.”</p>

<p>“There’s no need to stand on ceremony,” the latter lady
interposed. “Arabella is good enough for me.”</p>

<p>“Arabella is good enough for any one,” said Miss
D’Arblay. “Well, the position is this. The part of my
father’s practice that was concerned with original
work—pottery figures and reliefs and models for goldsmith’s
work—will have to go. No one but a sculptor of his
own class could carry that on. But the wax figures for
the shop windows are different. When he first started,
he used to model the heads and limbs in clay and make
plaster casts from which to make the gelatine moulds
for the wax-work. But as time went on, these casts
accumulated and he very seldom had need to model fresh
heads or limbs. The old casts could be used over and
over again. Now there is a large collection of plaster
models in the studio—heads, arms, legs, and faces,
especially faces—and as I have a fair knowledge of the
wax-work, from watching my father and sometimes helping
him, it seemed that I might be able to carry on that part
of the practice.”</p>

<p>“You think you could make the wax figures yourself?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Of course she could,” exclaimed Miss Boler. “She’s
her father’s daughter. Julius D’Arblay was a man who
could do anything he turned his hand to and do it well.
And Miss Marion is just like him. She is quite a good
modeller—so her father said; and she wouldn’t have to
make the figures. Only the wax parts.”</p>

<p>“Then they are not wax all over?” said I.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Miss D’Arblay. “They are just
dummies; wooden frameworks covered with stuffed canvas,
with wax heads, busts, and arms, and shaped legs. That
was what poor Daddy used to hate about them. He would
have liked to model complete figures.”</p>

<p>“And as to the business side. Could you dispose of
them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I could do them satisfactorily. The agent
who dealt with my father’s work has already written to
me asking if I could carry on. I know he will help me
so far as he can. He was quite fond of my father.”</p>

<p>“And you have nothing else in view?”</p>

<p>“Nothing by which I could earn a real living. For the
last year or two I have worked at writing and
illuminating; addresses, testimonials, and church services, when
I could get them, and filled in the time writing special
window-tickets. But that isn’t very remunerative,
whereas the wax figures would yield quite a good living.
And then,” she added, after a pause, “I have the feeling
that Daddy would have liked me to carry on his work,
and I should like it myself. He taught me quite a lot
and I think he meant me to join him when he got old.”</p>

<p>As she had evidently made up her mind, and as her
decision seemed quite a wise one, I concurred with as
much enthusiasm as I could muster.</p>

<p>“I am glad you agree,” said she, “and I know Arabella
does. So that is settled, subject to my being able to
carry out the plan. And now, if we have finished, I
should like to show you some of my father’s works. The
house is full of them and so, even, is the garden.
Perhaps we had better go there first before the light fails.”</p>

<p>As the treasures of this singularly interesting home
were presented, one after another, for my inspection, I
began to realize the truth of Miss Boler’s statement.
Julius D’Arblay had been a remarkably versatile man.
He had worked in all sorts of mediums and in all equally
well. From the carved stone sundial and the leaden
garden figures to the clock-case decorated with gilded
gesso and enriched with delicate bronze plaquettes, all
his works were eloquent of masterly skill and a fresh,
graceful fancy. It seems to me little short of a tragedy
that an artist of his ability should have spent the greater
part of his time in fabricating those absurd, posturing
effigies that simper and smirk so grotesquely in the
enormous windows of Vanity Fair.</p>

<p>I had intended, in compliance with the polite
conventions, to make this, my first visit, a rather short one; but
a tentative movement to depart only elicited protests, and
I was easily persuaded to stay until the exigencies of Dr.
Cornish’s practice seemed to call me. When at last I shut
the gate of Ivy Cottage behind me and glanced back at
the two figures standing in the lighted doorway, I had
the feeling of turning away from a house with which, and
its inmates, I had been familiar for years.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Mecklenburgh-square I found a note
which had been left by hand earlier in the evening. It
was from Dr. Thorndyke, asking me, if possible, to lunch
with him at his chambers on the morrow. I looked over
my visiting list, and finding that Monday would be a
light day—most of my days here were light days—I
wrote a short letter accepting the invitation and posted
it forthwith.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII. <br/> Enlarging Thorndyke’s Knowledge</h2>

<p>“I am glad you were able to come,” said Thorndyke,
as we took our places at the table. “Your letter was a
shade ambiguous. You spoke of discussing the D’Arblay
case, but I think you had something more than discussion
in your mind.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right,” I replied. “I had in my mind
to ask if it would be possible for me to retain you—I
believe that is the correct expression—to investigate the
case, as the police seem to think there is nothing to go
on; and if the costs would be likely to be within my
means.”</p>

<p>“As to the costs,” said he, “we can dismiss them. I
see no reason to suppose that there would be any costs.”</p>

<p>“But your time, Sir⸺” I began.</p>

<p>He laughed derisively. “Do you propose to pay me
for indulging in my pet hobby? No, my dear fellow,
it is I who should pay you for bringing a most
interesting and intriguing case to my notice. So your
questions are answered. I shall be delighted to look into
this case, and there will be no costs unless we have to
pay for some special services. If we do, I will let you
know.”</p>

<p>I was about to utter a protest, but he continued:</p>

<p>“And now, having disposed of the preliminaries, let
us consider the case itself. Your very shrewd and
capable inspector believes that the Scotland Yard people
will take no active measures unless some new facts turn
up. I have no doubt he is right, and I think they are
right, too. They can’t spend a lot of time—which means
public money—on a case in which hardly any data are
available, and which holds out no promise of any result.
But we mustn’t forget that we are in the same boat.
Our chances of success are infinitesimal. This
investigation is a forlorn hope. That, I may say, is what
commends it to me; but I want you to understand clearly
that failure is what we have to expect.”</p>

<p>“I understand that,” I answered gloomily, but
nevertheless rather disappointed at this pessimistic view.
“There seems to be nothing whatever to go upon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t so bad as that,” he rejoined. “Let us just
run over the data that we have. Our object is to fix the
identity of the man who killed Julius D’Arblay. Let us
see what we know about him. We will begin with the
evidence at the inquest. From that we learned: 1. That
he is a man of some education, ingenious, subtle,
resourceful. This murder was planned with extraordinary
ingenuity and foresight. The body was found in the pond
with no telltale mark on it but an almost invisible
pinprick in the back. The chances were a thousand to one,
or more, against that tiny puncture ever being observed;
and if it had not been observed, the verdict would have
been ‘Found drowned,’ or ‘Found dead,’ and the fact of
the murder would never have been discovered.</p>

<p>“2. We also learn that he has some knowledge of
poisons. The common, vulgar, poisoner is reduced to
fly-papers, weed-killer, or rat-poison—arsenic or strychnine.
But this man selects the most suitable of all poisons for his
purpose, and administers it in the most effective manner;
with a hypodermic syringe.</p>

<p>“3. We learned further that he must have had some
extraordinarily strong reason for making away with
D’Arblay. He made most elaborate plans, he took
endless trouble—for instance, it must have been no easy
matter to get possession of that quantity of aconitine
(unless he were a doctor, which God forbid!). That
strong reason—the motive, in fact—is the key of the
problem. It is the murderer’s one vulnerable point, for
it can hardly be beyond discovery; and its discovery must
be our principal objective.”</p>

<p>I nodded, not without some self-congratulation as I
recalled how I had made this very point in my talk with
Miss D’Arblay.</p>

<p>“Those,” Thorndyke continued, “are the data that the
inquest furnished. Now we come to those added by
Inspector Follett.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that they help us at all,” said I. “The
ancient coin was a curious find, but it doesn’t appear to
tell us anything new excepting that this man may have
been a collector or a dealer. On the other hand, he may
not. It doesn’t seem to me that the coin has any
significance.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it really?” said Thorndyke, as he refilled my
glass. “You are surely overlooking the very curious
coincidence that it presents.”</p>

<p>“What coincidence is that?” I asked, in some surprise.</p>

<p>“The coincidence,” he replied, “that both the murderer
and the victim should be, to a certain extent, connected
with a particular form of activity. Here is a man who
commits a murder and who, at the time of committing it
appears to have been in possession of a coin, which is not
a current coin, but a collector’s piece; and behold! the
murdered man is a sculptor—a man who, presumably,
was capable of making a coin, or at least the working
model.”</p>

<p>“There is no evidence,” I objected, “that D’Arblay was
capable of cutting a die. He was not a die sinker.”</p>

<p>“There was no need for him to be,” Thorndyke
rejoined. “Formerly, the medallist who designed the coin
cut the die himself. But that is not the modern practice.
Nowadays, the designer makes the model, first in wax
and then in plaster, on a comparatively large scale. The
model of a shilling may be three inches or more in
diameter. The actual die-sinking is done by a copying
machine which produces a die of the required size by
mechanical reduction. I think there could be no doubt
that D’Arblay could have modelled the design for a coin
on the usual scale, say three or four inches in diameter.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I agreed, “he certainly could, for I have seen
some of his small relief work; some little plaquettes, not
more than two inches long and most delicately and
beautifully modelled. But still, I don’t see the connexion,
otherwise than as a rather odd coincidence.”</p>

<p>“There may be nothing more,” said he. “There may
be nothing in it at all. But odd coincidences should
always be noted with very special attention.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I realize that. But I can’t imagine what
significance there could be in the coincidence.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Thorndyke, “let us take an imaginary
case, just as an illustration. Suppose this man to have
been a fraudulent dealer in antiquities; and suppose him
to have obtained enlarged photographs of a medal or coin
of extreme rarity and of great value, which was in some
museum or private collection. Suppose him to have taken
the photographs to D’Arblay and commissioned him to
model from them a pair of exact replicas in hardened
plaster. From those plaster models he could, with a
copying machine, produce a pair of dies with which he
could strike replicas in the proper metal and of the exact
size; and these could be sold for large sums to judiciously
chosen collectors.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe D’Arblay would have accepted such a
commission,” I exclaimed indignantly.</p>

<p>“We may assume that he would not, if the fraudulent
intent had been known to him. But it would not have
been; and there is no reason why he should have refused
a commission merely to make a copy. Still, I am not
suggesting that anything of the kind really happened. I
am simply giving you an illustration of one of the
innumerable ways in which a perfectly honest sculptor
might be made use of by a fraudulent dealer. In that
case his honesty would be a source of danger to him;
for if a really great fraud were perpetrated by means of
his work, it would clearly be to the interest of the
perpetrator to get rid of him. An honest and unconscious
collaborator in a crime is apt to be a dangerous witness
if questions arise.”</p>

<p>I was a good deal impressed by this demonstration.
Here, it seemed to me, was something very like a tangible
clue. But at this point Thorndyke again applied a cold
douche.</p>

<p>“Still,” he said, “we are only dealing with generalities,
and rather speculative ones. Our assumptions are
subject to all sorts of qualifications. It is possible, for
instance, though very improbable, that D’Arblay may have
been murdered in error by a perfect stranger; that he
may have walked into an ambush prepared for some one
else. Again, the coin may not have belonged to the
murderer at all, though that is also most improbable. But
there are numerous possibilities of error; and we can
eliminate them only by following up each suggested clue
and seeking verification or disproof. Every new fact
that we learn is a multiple gain. For as money makes
money, so knowledge begets knowledge.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” I answered dejectedly—for it
sounded rather like a platitude; “but I don’t see any
means of following up any of these clues.”</p>

<p>“We are going to follow up one of them after lunch,
if you have time,” said he. As he spoke, he took from
the table drawer a paper packet and a jeweller’s leather
case. “This,” he said, handing me the packet, “contains
your sealing-wax moulds. You had better take care of
them and keep the box with the marked side up to prevent
the wax from warping. Here are a pair of casts in
hardened plaster—‘fictile ivory,’ as it is called—which my
assistant, Polton, has made.”</p>

<p>He opened the case and passed it to me, when I saw
that it was lined with purple velvet and contained what
looked like two old ivory replicas of the mysterious coin.</p>

<p>“Mr. Polton is quite an artist,” I said, regarding them
admiringly. “But what are you going to do with these?”</p>

<p>“I had intended to take them round to the British
Museum and show them to the keeper of the coins and
medals, or one of his colleagues. But I think I will
just ask a few questions and hear what he says before
I produce the casts. Have you time to come round
with me?”</p>

<p>“I shall make time. But what do you want to know
about the coin?”</p>

<p>“It is just a matter of verification,” he replied. “My
books on the British coinage describe the Charles the
Second guinea as having a tiny elephant under the bust
on the obverse, to show that the gold from which it was
minted came from the Guinea Coast.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I. “Well, there is a little elephant under
the bust in this coin.”</p>

<p>“True,” he replied. “But this elephant has a castle on
his back, and would ordinarily be described as an elephant
and castle, to distinguish him from the plain elephant
which appeared on some coins. What I want to ascertain
is whether there were two different types of guinea. The
books make no mention of a second variety.”</p>

<p>“Surely they would have referred to it if there had
been,” said I.</p>

<p>“So I thought,” he replied; “but it is better to make
sure than to think.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is,” I agreed without much conviction,
“though I don’t see that, even if there were two varieties,
that fact would have any bearing on what we want to
know.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” he admitted. “But then you can never
tell what a fact will prove until you are in possession of
the fact. And now, as we seem to have finished, perhaps
we had better make our way to the Museum.”</p>

<p>The department of coins and medals is associated in
my mind with an impassive-looking Chinese person in
bronze who presides over the upper landing of the main
staircase. In fact, we halted for a moment before him
to exchange a final word.</p>

<p>“It will probably be best,” said Thorndyke, “to say
nothing about this coin, or, indeed, about anything else.
We don’t want to enter into any explanations.”</p>

<p>“No,” I agreed. “It is best to keep one’s own counsel;”
and with this we entered the hall, where Thorndyke led
the way to a small door and pressed the electric bell-push.
An attendant admitted us, and when we had signed our
names in the visitors’ book, he ushered us into the keeper’s
room. As we entered, a keen-faced, middle-aged man
who was seated at a table inspected us over his spectacles,
and, apparently recognizing Thorndyke, rose and held out
his hand.</p>

<p>“Quite a long time since I have seen you,” he remarked
after the preliminary greetings. “I wonder what your
quest is this time.”</p>

<p>“It is a very simple one,” said Thorndyke. “I am
going to ask if you can let me look at a Charles the
Second guinea dated 1663.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I can,” was the reply, accompanied by an
inquisitive glance at my friend. “It is not a rarity, you
know.”</p>

<p>He crossed the room to a large cabinet, and having run
his eye over the multitudinous labels, drew out a small,
very shallow drawer. With this in his hand he returned,
and picking a coin out of its circular pit, held it out to
Thorndyke, who took it from him, holding it delicately
by the edge. He looked at it attentively for a few
moments, and then silently presented the obverse for my
inspection. Naturally my eye at once sought the little
elephant under the bust, and there it was; but there was
no castle on its back.</p>

<p>“Is this the only type of guinea issued at that date?”
Thorndyke asked.</p>

<p>“The only type,” was the reply. “This is the first issue
of the guinea.”</p>

<p>“There was no variation or alternative form?”</p>

<p>“There was a form which had no elephant under the
bust. Only those which were minted from African gold
bore the elephant.”</p>

<p>“I notice that this coin has a plain elephant under the
bust; but I seem to have heard of a guinea, bearing this
date, which had an elephant and castle under the bust.
You are sure there was no such guinea?”</p>

<p>Our official friend shook his head as he took the coin
from Thorndyke and replaced it in its cell. “As sure,”
he replied, “as one can be of a universal negative. The
elephant and castle did not appear until 1685.” He picked
up the drawer and was just moving away towards the
cabinet when there came a sudden change in his manner.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he exclaimed, stopping and putting down the
drawer. “You are quite right. Only it was not an issue;
it was a trial piece, and only a single coin was struck. I
will tell you about it. There is a rather curious story
hanging to that piece.</p>

<p>“This guinea, as you probably know, was struck from
dies cut by John Roettier, and was one of the first coined
by the mill-and-screw process in place of the old
hammer-and-pile method. Now when Roettier had finished the
dies, a trial piece was struck; and in striking that piece
the obverse die cracked right across, but apparently only
at the last turn of the screw, for the trial piece was
quite perfect. Of course, Roettier had to cut a new die;
and for some reason he made a slight alteration. The
first die had an elephant and castle under the bust. In
the second one he changed this to a plain elephant. So
your impression was, so far, correct; but the coin, if it
still exists, is absolutely unique.”</p>

<p>“Is it not known, then, what became of that trial
piece?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—up to a point. That is the queerest part of
the story. For a time it remained in the possession of
the Slingsby family—Slingsby was the Master of the
Mint when it was struck. Then it passed through the
hands of various collectors, and finally was bought by an
American collector named Van Zellen. Now Van Zellen
was a millionaire, and his collection was a typical
millionaire’s collection. It consisted entirely of things of
enormous value which no ordinary man could afford, or of
unique things of which nobody could possibly have a
duplicate. It seems that he was a rather solitary man,
and that he spent most of his evenings alone in his
museum, gloating over his possessions.</p>

<p>“One morning Van Zellen was found dead in the little
study attached to the museum. That was about eighteen
months ago. There was an empty champagne bottle on
the table and a half-emptied glass, which smelt of bitter
almonds, and in his pocket was an empty phial labelled
‘Hydrocyanic Acid.’ At first it was assumed that he had
committed suicide, but when, later, the collection was
examined, it was found that a considerable part of it was
missing. A clean sweep had been made of the gems,
jewels, and other portable objects of value, and, among
other things, this unique trial guinea had vanished.
Surely you remember the case?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Thorndyke. “I do, now you mention
it, but I never heard what was stolen. Do you happen
to know what the later developments were?”</p>

<p>“There were none. The identity of the murderer was
never even guessed at, and not a single item of the stolen
property has ever been traced. To this day the crime
remains an impenetrable mystery—unless you know
something about it,” and again our friend cast an inquisitive
glance at Thorndyke.</p>

<p>“My practice,” the latter replied, “does not extend to
the United States. Their own very efficient investigators
seem to be able to do all that is necessary. But I am very
much obliged to you for having given us so much of
your time, to say nothing of this extremely interesting
information. I shall make a note of it, for American
crime occasionally has its repercussions on this side.”</p>

<p>I secretly admired the adroit way in which Thorndyke
had evaded the rather pointed question without making
any actual mis-statement. But the motive for the evasion
was not very obvious to me. I was about to put a
question on the subject, but he anticipated it, for, as soon as
we were outside, he remarked with a chuckle: “It is just
as well that we didn’t begin by exhibiting the casts. We
could hardly have sworn our friend to secrecy, seeing that
the original is undoubtedly stolen property.”</p>

<p>“But aren’t you going to draw the attention of the
police to the fact?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” he replied. “They have got the original,
and no doubt they have a list of the stolen property. We
must assume that they will make use of their knowledge;
but if they don’t, it may be all the better for us. The
police are very discreet; but they do sometimes give the
Press more information than I should. And what is told
to the Press is told to the criminal.”</p>

<p>“And why not?” I asked. “What is the harm of his
knowing?”</p>

<p>“My dear Gray!” exclaimed Thorndyke. “You surprise
me. Just consider the position. This man aimed
at being entirely unsuspected. That failed. But still his
identity is unknown, and he is probably confident that it
will never be ascertained. Then he is, so far, off his
guard. There is no need for him to disappear or go into
hiding. But let him know that he is being tracked and
he will almost certainly take fresh precautions against
discovery. Probably he will slip away beyond our reach.
Our aim must be to encourage in him a feeling of perfect
security; and that aim commits us to the strictest secrecy.
No one must know what cards we hold or that we hold
any; or even that we are taking a hand.”</p>

<p>“What about Miss D’Arblay?” I asked anxiously.
“May I not tell her that you are working on her behalf?”</p>

<p>He looked at me somewhat dubiously. “It would
obviously be better not to,” he said, “but that might seem
a little unfriendly and unsympathetic.”</p>

<p>“It would be an immense relief to her to know that
you are trying to help her, and I think you could trust
her to keep your secrets.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he conceded. “But warn her very
thoroughly. Remember that our antagonist is hidden from
us. Let us remain hidden from him, so far as our
activities are concerned.”</p>

<p>“I will make her promise absolute secrecy,” I agreed:
and then, with a slight sense of anti-climax, I added:
“But we don’t seem to have so very much to conceal.
This curious story of the stolen coin is interesting, but
it doesn’t appear to get us any more forward.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it?” he asked. “Now I was just
congratulating myself on the progress that we had made; on the
way in which we are narrowing down the field of
inquiry. Let us trace our progress. When you found
the body there was no evidence as to the cause of death;
no suspicion of any agent whatever. Then came the
inquest, demonstrating the cause of death and bringing
into view a person of unknown identity, but having
certain distinguishing characteristics. Then Follett’s
discovery added some further characteristics and suggested
certain possible motives for the crime. But still there
was no hint as to the person’s identity or position in life.
Now we have good evidence that he is a professional
criminal of a dangerous type, that he is connected with
another crime and with a quantity of easily identified
stolen property. We also know that he was in America
about eighteen months ago, and we can easily get exact
information as to dates and locality. This man is no
longer a mere formless shadow. He is in a definite
category of possible persons.”</p>

<p>“But,” I objected, “the fact that he had the coin in his
possession does not prove that he is the man who stole
it.”</p>

<p>“Not by itself,” Thorndyke agreed. “But taken in
conjunction with the crime, it is almost conclusive. You
appear to be overlooking the striking similarity of the
two crimes. Each was a violent murder committed by
means of poison; and in each case, the poison selected
was the most suitable one for the purpose. The one,
aconitine, was calculated to escape detection; the other,
hydrocyanic acid—the most rapidly acting of all poisons—was
calculated to produce almost instant death in a
man who was probably struggling and might have raised
an alarm. I think we are fairly justified in assuming
that the murderer of Van Zellen was the murderer of
D’Arblay. If that is so, we have two groups of
circumstances to investigate, two tracks by which to follow him;
and, sooner or later, I feel confident, we shall be able
to give him a name. Then if we have kept our own
counsel, and he is unconscious of the pursuit, we shall
be able to lay our hands on him. But here we are at
the Foundling Hospital. It is time for each of us to
get back to the routine of duty.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII. <br/> Simon Bendelow, Deceased</h2>

<p>It was near the close of my incumbency of Dr.
Cornish’s practice—indeed, Cornish had returned on the
previous evening—that my unsatisfactory attendance on
Mr. Simon Bendelow came to an end. It had been a
wearisome affair. In medical practice, perhaps even more
than in most human activities, continuous effort calls for
the sustenance of achievement. A patient who cannot
be cured or even substantially relieved is of all patients
the most depressing. Week after week I had made my
fruitless visits, had watched the silent, torpid sufferer
grow yet more shrivelled and wasted, speculating even
a little impatiently on the possible duration of his
long-drawn-out passage to the grave. But at last the end
came.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Morris,” I said as that grim
female opened the door and surveyed me impassively,
“and how is our patient to-day?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t our patient any longer,” she replied. “He’s
dead.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” I exclaimed. “Well, it had to be, sooner or
later. Poor Mr. Bendelow! When did he die?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday afternoon, about five,” she answered.</p>

<p>“H’m. If you had sent me a note I could have brought
the certificate. However, I can post it to you. Shall I
go up and have a look at him?”</p>

<p>“You can if you like,” she replied. “But the ordinary
certificate won’t be enough in this case. He is going to
be cremated.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” said I, once more unpleasantly conscious
of my inexperience. “What sort of certificate is required
for cremation?”</p>

<p>“Oh, all sorts of formalities have to be gone through,”
she answered. “Just come into the drawing-room, and I
will tell you what has to be done.”</p>

<p>She preceded me along the passage, and I followed
meekly, anathematizing myself for my ignorance, and my
instructors for having sent me forth crammed with
academic knowledge, but with the practical business of my
profession all to learn.</p>

<p>“Why are you having him cremated?” I asked, as
we entered the room and shut the door.</p>

<p>“Because it is one of the provisions of his will,” she
answered. “I may as well let you see it.”</p>

<p>She opened a bureau and took from it a foolscap
envelope, from which she drew out a folded document.
This she first unfolded and then re-folded, so that its
concluding clauses were visible, and laid it on the flap
of the bureau. Placing her finger on it, she said: “That
is the cremation clause. You had better read it.”</p>

<p>I ran my eye over the clause, which read: “I desire
that my body shall be cremated, and I appoint Sarah
Elizabeth Morris, the wife of the aforesaid James Morris,
to be the residuary legatee and sole executrix of this my
will.” Then followed the attestation clause, underneath
which was the shaky but characteristic signature of
“Simon Bendelow,” and opposite this the signatures of
the witnesses, Anne Dewsnep and Martha Bonington,
both described as spinsters and both of a joint address
which was hidden by the folding of the document.</p>

<p>“So much for that,” said Mrs. Morris, returning the
will to its envelope; “and now as to the certificate. There
is a special form for cremation which has to be signed
by two doctors, and one of them must be a hospital
doctor or a consultant. So I wrote off at once to Dr.
Cropper, as he knew the patient, and I have had a
telegram from him this morning saying that he will be here
this evening at eight o’clock to examine the body and sign
the certificate. Can you manage to meet him at that
time?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “fortunately I can, as Dr. Cornish is
back.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said she; “then in that case you needn’t go
up now. You will be able to make the examination
together. Eight o’clock, sharp, remember.”</p>

<p>With this she re-conducted me along the passage and—I
had almost said ejected me; but she sped the parting
guest with a business-like directness that was perhaps
accounted for by the presence opposite the door of one
of those grim parcels-delivery vans in which undertakers
distribute their wares, and from which a rough-looking
coffin was at the moment being hoisted out by two men.</p>

<p>The extraordinary promptitude of this proceeding so
impressed me that I remarked: “They haven’t been long
making the coffin.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t have to make it,” she replied. “I ordered
it a month ago. It’s no use leaving things to the last
moment.”</p>

<p>I turned away with somewhat mixed feelings. There
was certainly a horrible efficiency about this woman.
Executrix, indeed! Her promptness in carrying out the
provisions of the will was positively appalling. She
must have written to Cropper before the breath was fairly
out of poor Bendelow’s body, but her forethought in the
matter of the coffin fairly made my flesh creep.</p>

<p>Dr. Cornish made no difficulty about taking over
the evening consultations, in fact he had intended to do
so in any case. Accordingly, after a rather early dinner,
I made my way in leisurely fashion back to Hoxton,
where, after all, I arrived fully ten minutes too soon.
I realized my prematureness when I halted at the corner
of Market-street to look at my watch; and as ten
additional minutes of Mrs. Morris’s society offered no
allurement, I was about to turn back and fill up the time with
a short walk when my attention was arrested by a mast
which had just appeared above the wall at the end of
the street. With its black-painted truck and halyard
blocks and its long tricolour pennant, it looked like the
mast of a Dutch schuyt or galliot, but I could hardly
believe it possible that such a craft could make its
appearance in the heart of London. All agog with curiosity, I
hurried up the street and looked over the wall at the canal
below; and there, sure enough, she was—a big Dutch
sloop, broad-bosomed, massive, and mediæval, just such
a craft as one may see in the pictures of old Vandervelde,
painted when Charles the Second was king.</p>

<p>I leaned on the low wall and watched her with delighted
interest as she crawled forward slowly to her berth,
bringing with her, as it seemed, a breath of the distant sea
and the echo of the surf, murmuring on sandy beaches.
I noted appreciatively her old-world air, her antique build,
her gay and spotless paint, and the muslin curtains in the
little windows of her deck-house, and was, in fact, so
absorbed in watching her that the late Simon Bendelow
had passed completely out of my mind. Suddenly,
however, the chiming of a clock recalled me to my present
business. With a hasty glance at my watch I tore myself
away reluctantly, darted across the street, and gave a
vigorous pull at the bell.</p>

<p>Dr. Cropper had not yet arrived, but the deceased had
not been entirely neglected, for when I had spent some
five minutes staring inquisitively about the drawing-room
into which Mrs. Morris had shown me, that lady
returned, accompanied by two other ladies, whom she
introduced to me somewhat informally by the names of
Miss Dewsnep and Miss Bonington respectively. I
recognized the names as those of the two witnesses to the will
and inspected them with furtive curiosity, though, indeed,
they were quite unremarkable excepting as typical
specimens of the genus elderly spinster.</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Bendelow!” murmured Miss Dewsnep,
shaking her head and causing an artificial cherry on her
bonnet to waggle idiotically. “How beautiful he looks in his
coffin!”</p>

<p>She looked at me as if for confirmation, so that I was
fain to admit that his beauty in this new setting had not
yet been revealed to me.</p>

<p>“So peaceful,” she added, with another shake of her
head, and Miss Bonington chimed in with the comment,
“Peaceful and restful.” Then they both looked at me
and I mumbled indistinctly that I had no doubt he did;
the fact being that the inmates of coffins are not in general
much addicted to boisterous activity.</p>

<p>“Ah!” Miss Dewsnep resumed, “how little did I think
when I first saw him, sitting up in bed so cheerful in that
nice, sunny room in the house at⸺”</p>

<p>“Why not?” interrupted Mrs. Morris. “Did you think
he was going to live for ever?”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Morris, ma’am,” was the dignified reply,
“I did not. No such idea ever entered my head. I know
too well that we mortals are all born to be gathered in
at last as the—er—as the⸺”</p>

<p>“Sparks fly upwards,” murmured Miss Bonington.</p>

<p>“As the corn is gathered in at harvest time,” Miss
Dewsnep continued with slight emphasis. “But not to be
cast into a burning fiery furnace. When I first saw
him in the other house at⸺”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what objection you need have to
cremation,” interrupted Mrs. Morris. “It was his own choice,
and a good one, too. Look at those great cemeteries.
What sense is there in letting the dead occupy the space
that is wanted for the living?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Miss Dewsnep, “I may be old-fashioned,
but it does seem to me that a nice, quiet funeral with
plenty of flowers and a proper, decent grave in a
church-yard is the natural end to a human life. That is what
I look forward to, myself.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not likely to be disappointed,” said
Mrs. Morris; “though I don’t quite see what satisfaction
you expect to get out of your own funeral.”</p>

<p>Miss Dewsnep made no reply, and an interval of
dismal silence followed. Mrs. Morris was evidently
impatient of Dr. Cropper’s unpunctuality. I could see that
she was listening intently for the sound of the bell, as
she had been even while the conversation was in progress;
indeed, I had been dimly conscious all the while of a sense
of tension and anxiety on her part. She had seemed to
me to watch her two friends with a sort of uneasiness, and
to give a quite uncalled-for attention to their rather trivial
utterances.</p>

<p>At length her suspense was relieved by a loud ringing
of the bell. She started up and opened the door, but she
had barely crossed the threshold when she suddenly turned
back and addressed me.</p>

<p>“That will be Dr. Cropper. Perhaps you had better
come out with me and meet him.”</p>

<p>It struck me as an odd suggestion, but I rose without
comment and followed her along the passage to the street
door, which we reached just as another loud peal of the
bell sounded in the house behind us. She flung the
door wide open, and a small, spectacled man charged in
and seized my hand, which he shook with violent
cordiality.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Morris?” he exclaimed. “So
sorry to keep you waiting, but I was unfortunately
detained at a consultation.”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Morris sourly intervened to explain who I
was; upon which he shook my hand again, and expressed
his joy at making my acquaintance. He also made polite
inquiries as to our hostess’ health, which she
acknowledged gruffly over her shoulder as she preceded us along
the passage, which was now pitch-dark, and where
Cropper dropped his hat and trod on it, finally bumping
his head against the unseen wall in a frantic effort to
recover it.</p>

<p>When we emerged into the dimly lighted hall, I
observed the two ladies peering inquisitively out of the
drawing-room door. But Mrs. Morris took no notice of
them, leading the way directly up the stairs to the room
with which I was already familiar. It was poorly
illuminated by a single gas-bracket over the fireplace, but the
light was enough to show us a coffin resting on three
chairs, and beyond it the shadowy figure of a man whom
I recognized as Mr. Morris.</p>

<p>We crossed the room to the coffin, which was plainly
finished with zinc fastenings, in accordance with the
regulations of the cremation authorities, and had let into
the top what I first took to be a pane of glass, but which
turned out to be a plate of clear celluloid. When we
had made our salutations to Mr. Morris, Cropper and I
looked in through the celluloid window. The yellow,
shrunken face of the dead man, surmounted by the skull
cap which he had always worn, looked so little changed
that he might still have been in the drowsy, torpid state
in which I had been accustomed to see him. He had
always looked so like a dead man that the final transition
was hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Morris, “you would like to have
the coffin-lid taken off?”</p>

<p>“God bless my soul, yes!” exclaimed Cropper. “What
are we here for? We shall want him out of the coffin,
too.”</p>

<p>“Are you proposing to make a post-mortem?” I asked,
observing that Dr. Cropper had brought a good-sized
handbag. “It seems hardly necessary, as we both know
what he died of.”</p>

<p>Cropper shook his head. “That won’t do,” said he.
“You mustn’t treat a cremation certificate as a mere
formality. We have got to certify that we have verified
the cause of death. Looking at a body through a
window is not verifying the cause of death. We should
cut a pretty figure in a court of law if any question arose
and we had to admit that we had certified without any
examination at all. But we needn’t do much, you know.
Just get the body out on the bed and a single small
incision will settle the nature of the growth. Then
everything will be regular and in order. I hope you don’t
mind, Mrs. Morris,” he added, suavely, turning to that
lady.</p>

<p>“You must do what you think necessary,” she replied,
indifferently. “It is no affair of mine;” and with this
she went out of the room and shut the door.</p>

<p>While we had been speaking, Mr. Morris, who
apparently had kept a screwdriver in readiness for the
possible contingency, had been neatly extracting the zinc
screws and now lifted off the coffin-lid. Then the three
of us raised the shrivelled body—it was as light as a
child’s—and laid it on the bed. I left Cropper to do
what he thought necessary, and while he was unpacking
his instruments I took the opportunity to have a good
look at Mr. Morris; for it is a singular fact that in all
the weeks of my attendance at this house I had never
come into contact with him since that first morning when
I had caught a momentary glimpse of him as he looked
out over the blind through the glazed shop door. In the
interval his appearance had changed considerably for the
better. He was no longer a merely unshaved man; his
beard had grown to a respectable length, and, so far as
I could judge in the uncertain light, the hare-lip scar was
completely concealed by his moustache.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Cropper, as he polished a scalpel
on the palm of his hand, “when did you say Mr.
Bendelow died?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday afternoon at about five o’clock,” replied Mr.
Morris.</p>

<p>“Did he really?” said Cropper, lifting one of the limp
arms and letting it drop on the bed. “Yesterday
afternoon! Now, Gray, doesn’t that show how careful one
should be in giving opinions as to the time that has
elapsed since death? If I had been shown this body and
asked how long the man had been dead, I should have
said three or four days. There isn’t the least trace of
rigor mortis left; and the other appearances—but there
it is. You are never safe in giving dogmatic opinions.”</p>

<p>“No,” I agreed. “I should have said he had been
dead more than twenty-four hours. But I suppose there
is a good deal of variation.”</p>

<p>“There is,” he replied. “You can’t apply averages to
particular cases.”</p>

<p>I did not consider it necessary to take any active part
in the proceedings. It was his diagnosis, and it was for
him to verify it. At his request Mr. Morris fetched a
candle and held it as he was directed; and while these
preparations were in progress, I looked out of the
window, which commanded a partial view of the canal. The
moon had now risen and its full light fell on the
white-painted hull of the Dutch sloop, which had come to rest
and made fast alongside a small wharf. It was quite
a pleasant picture, strangely at variance with the squalid
neighbourhood around. As I looked down on the little
vessel, with the ruddy light glowing from the deck-house
windows and casting shimmering reflections in the quiet
water, the sight seemed to carry me far away from the
sordid streets around into the fellowship of the breezy
ocean and the far-away shores whence the little craft
had sailed; and I determined, as soon as our business was
finished, to seek some access to the canal and indulge
myself with a quiet stroll in the moonlight along the
deserted towing-path.</p>

<p>“Well, Gray,” said Cropper, standing up with the
scalpel and forceps in his hands, “there it is if you want
to see it. Typical carcinoma. Now we can sign the
certificates with a clear conscience. I’ll just put in a
stitch or two, and then we can put him back in his coffin.
I suppose you have got the forms?”</p>

<p>“They are downstairs,” said Mr. Morris. “When
we have got him back I will show you the way down.”</p>

<p>This, however, was unnecessary, as there was only one
staircase, and I was not a stranger. Accordingly, when
we had replaced the body, we took our leave of Mr.
Morris and departed; and, glancing back as I passed out
of the door, I saw him driving in the screws with the
ready skill of a cabinet-maker.</p>

<p>The filling-up of the forms was a portentous business
which was carried out in the drawing-room under the
superintendence of Mrs. Morris, and was watched with
respectful interest by the two spinsters. When it was
finished and I had handed the registration certificate to
Mrs. Morris, Cropper gathered up the forms “B” and
“C,” and slipped them into a long envelope on which the
Medical Referee’s address was printed.</p>

<p>“I will post this off to-night,” said he; “and you will
send in Form A, Mrs. Morris, when you have filled it
in.”</p>

<p>“I have sent it off already,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Dr. Cropper. “Then that is all; and
now I must run away. Can I put you down anywhere,
Gray?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, no,” I replied. “I thought of taking a
walk along the tow-path, if you can tell me how to get
down to it, Mrs. Morris.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” she replied. “But when Dr. Cropper has
gone, I will run up and ask my husband. I daresay he
knows.”</p>

<p>We escorted Cropper along the passage to the door,
which he reached without mishap, and having seen him
into his brougham, turned back to the hall, where Mrs.
Morris ascended the stairs, and I went into the
drawing-room, where the two spinsters appeared to be preparing
for departure. In a couple of minutes Mrs. Morris
returned, and seeing both the ladies standing, said: “You
are not going yet, Miss Dewsnep. You must have some
refreshment before you go. Besides, I thought you
wanted to see Mr. Bendelow again.”</p>

<p>“So we should,” said Miss Dewsnep. “Just a little
peep, to see how he looks after⸺”</p>

<p>“I will take you up in a minute,” interrupted Mrs.
Morris. “When Dr. Gray has gone.” Then addressing
me, she said: “My husband says that you can get down
to the tow-path through that alley nearly opposite. There
is a flight of steps at the end which comes right out on
the path.”</p>

<p>I thanked her for the direction, and having bidden
farewell to the spinsters, was once more escorted along
the passage and finally launched into the outer world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX. <br/> A Strange Misadventure</h2>

<p>Although I had been in harness but a few weeks, it
was with a pleasant sense of freedom that I turned from
the door and crossed the road towards the alley. My
time was practically my own, for, though I was remaining
with Dr. Cornish until the end of the week, he was now
in charge, and my responsibilities were at an end.</p>

<p>The alley was entered by an arched opening, so
narrow that I had never suspected it of being a public
thoroughfare, and I now threaded it with my shoulders
almost touching the walls. Whither it finally led I have
no idea, for when I reached another arched opening in
the left hand wall and saw that this gave on a flight of
stone steps, I descended the latter and found myself on
the tow-path. At the foot of the steps I stood awhile
and looked about me. The moon was nearly full, and
shone brightly on the opposite side of the canal, but the
tow-path was in deep shadow, being flanked by a high
wall, behind which were the houses of the adjoining
streets. Looking back—that is, to my left—I could just
make out the bridge and the adjoining buildings, all
their unlovely details blotted out by the thin night-haze,
which reduced them to mere flat shapes of grey. A little
nearer, one or two spots of ruddy light with wavering
reflections beneath them, marked the cabin windows of
the sloop, and her mast, rising above the grey obscurity,
was clearly visible against the sky.</p>

<p>Naturally, I turned in that direction, sauntering
luxuriously and filling my pipe as I went. Doubtless, by
day the place was sordid enough in aspect—though it is
hard to vulgarize a navigable water-way—but now, in
the moon-lit haze, the scene was almost romantic. And
it was astonishingly quiet and peaceful. From above,
beyond the high wall, the noises of the streets came
subdued and distant, like sounds from another world;
but here there was neither sound nor movement. The
tow-path was utterly deserted, and the only sign of
human life was the glimmer of light from the sloop.</p>

<p>It was delightfully restful. I found myself treading
the gravel lightly not to disturb the grateful silence, and
as I strolled along, enjoying my pipe, I let my thoughts
ramble idly from one topic to another. Somewhere
above me, in that rather mysterious house, Simon
Bendelow was lying in his narrow bed, the wasted, yellow
face looking out into the darkness through that queer little
celluloid window, or perhaps Miss Dewsnep and her friend
were even now taking their farewell peep at him. I
looked up, but, of course, the house was not visible from
the tow-path, nor was I now able to guess at its position.</p>

<p>A little farther, and the hull of the sloop came clearly
into view, and nearly opposite to it, on the tow-path, I
could see some kind of shed or hut against the wall,
with a derrick in front of it overhanging a little quay.
When I had nearly reached the shed, I passed a door in
the wall, which apparently communicated with some house
in one of the streets above. Then I came to the shed,
a small wooden building which probably served as a
lighterman’s office, and I noticed that the derrick swung
from one of the corner-posts. But at this moment my
attention was attracted by sounds of mild revelry from
across the canal. Some one in the sloop’s deck-house had
burst into song.</p>

<p>I stepped out on to the little quay and stood at the
edge, looking across at the homely curtained windows
and wondering what the interior of the deck-house looked
like at this moment. Suddenly my ear caught an audible
creak from behind me. I was in the act of turning to
see whence it came when something struck me a heavy,
glancing blow on the arm, crashed to the ground, and
sent me flying over the edge of the quay.</p>

<p>Fortunately the water here was not more than four
feet deep, and as I had plunged in feet first, and am a
good swimmer, I never lost control of myself. In a
moment I was standing up with my head and shoulders
out of water, not particularly alarmed, though a good
deal annoyed and much puzzled as to what had
happened. My first care was to recover my hat, which was
floating forlornly close by, and the next was to consider
how I should get ashore. My left arm was numb from
the blow and was evidently useless for climbing.
Moreover, the face of the quay was of smooth concrete, as
was also the wall below the tow-path. But I
remembered having passed a pair of boat-steps some fifty yards
back, and decided to make for them. I had thought of
hailing the sloop, but as the droning song still came from
the deck-house, it was clear that the Dutchmen had heard
nothing, and I did not think it worth while to disturb
them. Accordingly, I set forth for the steps, walking
with no little difficulty over the soft, muddy bottom,
keeping close to the side and steadying myself with my
right hand, with which I could just reach the edge of
the coping.</p>

<p>It seemed a long journey, for one cannot progress very
fast over soft mud with the water up to one’s armpits;
but at last I reached the steps and managed to scramble
up on to the tow-path. There I stood for a moment
or two irresolute. My first impulse was to hurry back
as fast as I could and seek the Morrises’ hospitality; for
I was already chilled to the bone and felt as physically
wretched as the proverbial cat in similar circumstances.
But I was devoured by curiosity as to what had
happened, and moreover I believed that I had dropped my
stick on the quay. The latter consideration decided me,
for it was a favourite stick, and I set out for the quay at
a very different pace from that at which I had approached
it the first time.</p>

<p>The mystery was solved long before I arrived at the
quay; at least it was solved in part. For the derrick
which had overhung the quay, now lay on the ground.
Obviously it had fallen—and had missed my head only
by a matter of inches. But how had it come to fall?
Again, obviously, the guy-rope had given way. As it
could not have broken, seeing that the derrick was
unloaded and the rope must have been strong enough to
bear the last load, I was a good deal puzzled as to how
the accident could have befallen. Nor was I much less
puzzled when I had made my inspection. The rope
was, of course, unbroken and its “fall”—the part below
the pulley-blocks—passed into the shed through a
window-like hole. This I could see as I approached, and
also that a door in the end of the shed nearest to me was
ajar. Opening it, I plunged into the dark interior, and
partly by touch and partly by the faint glimmer that came
in at the window, I was able to make out the state of
affairs. Just below the hole through which the rope
entered was a large cleat, on which the fall must have
been delayed. But the cleat was vacant, the rope hung
down from the hole and its end lay in an untidy raffle
on the floor. It looked as if it had been cast off the
cleat; but as there had apparently been no one in the
shed, the only possible supposition was that the rope had
been badly secured, that it had gradually worked loose
and had at last slipped off the cleat. But it was difficult
to understand how it had slipped right off.</p>

<p>I found my stick lying at the edge of the quay and
close by it my pipe. Having recovered these treasures,
I set off to retrace my steps along the tow-path, sped
on my way by a jovial chorus from the sloop. A very
few minutes brought me to the steps, which I ascended two
at a time, and then, having traversed the alley, I came
out sheepishly into Market-street. To my relief, I saw
a light in Mr. Morris’ shop, and could even make out
a moving figure in the background. I hurried across,
and, opening the glazed door, entered the shop, at the
back of which Mr Morris was seated at a bench filing
some small object which was fixed in a vice. He looked
round at me with no great cordiality, but suddenly
observing my condition, he dropped his file on the bench,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Good Lord, Doctor! What on earth have you been
doing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing on earth,” I replied, with a feeble grin, “but
something in the water. I’ve been into the canal.”</p>

<p>“But what for?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t go in intentionally,” I replied; and then
I gave him a sketch of the incident, as short as I could
make it, for my teeth were chattering and explanations
were chilly work. However, he rose nobly to the
occasion. “You’ll catch your death of cold!” he exclaimed,
starting up. “Come in here, and slip off your things at
once, while I go for some blankets.”</p>

<p>He led me into a little den behind the shop, and, having
lighted a gas fire, went out by a back door. I lost no
time in peeling off my dripping clothes, and by the time
that he returned I was in a state in which I ought to
have been when I took my plunge.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” said he. “Put on this dressing-gown
and wrap yourself in the blankets. We’ll draw this
chair up to the fire, and then you will be all right for
the present.”</p>

<p>I followed his directions, pouring out my thanks as
well as my chattering teeth would let me.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said he. “If you will empty
your pockets, the missus can put some of the things
through the wringer, and then they’ll soon dry. There
happens to be a good fire in the kitchen; some advance
cooking on account of the funeral. You can dry your
hat and boots here. If any one comes to the shop you
might just press that electric bell-push.”</p>

<p>When he had gone, I drew the Windsor armchair
close to the fire and made myself as comfortable as I
could, dividing my attention between my hat and my
boots, which called for careful roasting, and the contents
of the room. The latter appeared to be a sort of store
for the reserve stock-in-trade, and certainly this was
a most amazing collection. I could not see a single article
for which I would have given sixpence. The array on
the shelves suggested that the shop had been stocked with
the sweepings of all the stalls in Market-street, with those
of Shoreditch High-street thrown in. As I ran my eye
along the ranks of dial-less clocks, cracked fiddles,
stopperless decanters, and tattered theological volumes, I
found myself speculating profoundly on how Mr. Morris
made a livelihood. He professed to be a “dealer in
antiques,” and there was assuredly no question as to the
antiquity of the goods in this room. But there is little
pecuniary value in the kind of antiquity that is unearthed
from a dust bin.</p>

<p>It was really rather mysterious. Mr. Morris was a
somewhat superior man, and he did not appear to be poor.
Yet this shop did not seem capable of yielding an
income that would have been acceptable to a rag-picker.
And during the whole of the time in which I sat
warming myself, there was not a single visitor to the shop.
However, it was no concern of mine; and I had just
reached this sage conclusion when Mr. Morris returned
with my clothes.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, “they are very creased and
disreputable, but they are quite dry. They would have had
to be cleaned and pressed, in any case.”</p>

<p>With this he went out into the shop and resumed his
filing, while I put on the stiff and crumpled garments.
When I was dressed, I followed him and thanked him
effusively for his kind offices, leaving also a grateful
message for his wife. He took my thanks rather stolidly,
and having wished me “good night,” picked up his file
and fell to work again.</p>

<p>I decided to walk home; principally, I think, to avoid
exhibiting myself in a public vehicle. But my
self-consciousness soon wore off, and when, in the
neighbourhood of Clerkenwell, I perceived Dr. Usher, on the
opposite side of the street, I crossed the road and touched
his arm. He looked round quickly, and, recognizing me,
shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>“What are you doing on my beat at this time of night?”
he asked. “You are not still at Cornish’s, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered, “but not for long. I have just
made my last visit and signed the death certificate.”</p>

<p>“Good man,” said he. “Very methodical. Nothing
like finishing a case up neatly. They didn’t invite you
to the funeral, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, “and I shouldn’t have gone if they
had.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” he agreed. “Funerals are rather
outside medical practice. But you have to go sometimes.
Policy, you know. I had to go to one the day before
yesterday. Beastly nuisance it was. Chappie would
insist on putting me down at my own door in the
mourning coach. Meant well, of course, but it was very
awkward. All the neighbours came to their shop doors and
grinned as I got out. Felt an awful fool; couldn’t grin
back, you see. Had to keep up the farce to the end.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that it was exactly a farce,” I objected.</p>

<p>“That is because you weren’t there,” he retorted. “It
was the silliest exhibition you ever saw. Just think of
it! The parson who ran the show had actually got a
lot of schoolchildren to stand round the grave and sing
a blooming hymn: ‘Safe in the arms of’—you know the
confounded doggerel.”</p>

<p>“Well, why not?” I protested. “I daresay the friends
of the deceased liked it.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” said he. “I expect they put the parson
up to it. But it was sickening to hear those kids bleating
that stuff. How did they know where he was—an old
rip with malignant disease of the pancreas, too!”</p>

<p>“Really, Usher!” I exclaimed, laughing at his quaint
cynicism, “you are unreasonable. There are no pathological
disqualifications for the better land, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” he agreed, with a grin. “Don’t have
to show a clean bill of health before they let you in. But
it was a trying business, you must admit. I hate cant
of that sort; and yet one had to pull a long face and
join in the beastly chorus.”</p>

<p>The picture that his last words suggested was too
much for my gravity. I laughed long and joyously.
However, Usher was not offended; indeed, I suspect that
he appreciated the humour of the situation as much as
I did. But he had trained himself to an outward
solemnity of manner that was doubtless a valuable asset
in his particular class of practice, and he walked at my
side in unmoved gravity, taking an occasional, quick,
critical look at me. When we came to the parting of our
ways he once more shook my hand warmly and delivered
a little farewell speech.</p>

<p>“You’ve never been to see me, Gray. Haven’t had
time, I suppose. But when you are free you might look
me up one evening to have a smoke and a glass and
talk over old times. There’s always a bit of grub going,
you know.”</p>

<p>I promised to drop in before long, and he then added:
“I gave you one or two tips when I saw you last. Now
I’m going to give you another. Never neglect your
appearance. It’s a great mistake. Treat yourself with
respect and the world will respect you. No need to be
a dandy. But just keep an eye on your tailor and your
laundress—especially your laundress. Clean collars don’t
cost much and they pay; and so does a trousers press.
People expect a doctor to be well turned out. Now you
mustn’t think me impertinent. We are old pals and I
want you to get on. So long, old chap. Look me up as
soon as you can”; and without giving me the
opportunity to reply, he turned about and bustled off, swinging
his umbrella and offering, perhaps, a not very impressive
illustration of his own excellent precepts. But his words
served as a reminder which caused me to pursue the
remainder of my journey by way of side-streets neither
too well lighted nor too much frequented.</p>

<p>As I let myself in with my key and closed the street
door, Cornish stepped out of the dining-room.</p>

<p>“I thought you were lost, Gray,” said he. “Where
the deuce have you been all this time?” Then, as I came
into the light of the hall lamp, he exclaimed: “And what
in the name of Fortune have you been up to?”</p>

<p>“I have had a wetting,” I explained. “I’ll tell you all
about it presently.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Thorndyke is in the dining-room,” said he;
“came in a few minutes ago to see you.” He seized me
by the arm and ran me into the room, where I found
Thorndyke methodically filling his pipe. He looked up
as I entered and regarded me with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear fellow, you’ve been in the water!” he
exclaimed. “But yet your clothes are not wet. What
has been happening to you?”</p>

<p>“If you can wait a few minutes,” I replied, “while I
wash and change, I will relate my adventures. But
perhaps you haven’t time.”</p>

<p>“I want to hear all about it,” he replied, “so run along
and be as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>I bustled up to my room, and having washed and
executed a lightning change, came down to the
dining-room, where I found Cornish in the act of setting out
decanters and glasses.</p>

<p>“I’ve told Dr. Thorndyke what took you to Hoxton,”
said he, “and he wants a full account of everything that
happened. He is always suspicious of cremation cases, as
you know from his lectures.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember his warnings,” said I. “But this
was a perfectly commonplace, straightforward affair.”</p>

<p>“Did you go for your swim before or after the
examination?” Thorndyke asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, after,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Then let us hear about the examination first,” said
he.</p>

<p>On this I plunged into a detailed account of all that
had befallen since my arrival at Market-street, to which
Thorndyke listened, not only patiently, but with the
closest attention, and even cross-examined me to elicit
further details. Everything seemed to interest him, from
the construction of the coffin to the contents of Mr.
Morris’ shop. When I had finished, Cornish remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, it is a queer affair. I don’t understand that
rope at all. Ropes don’t uncleat themselves. They may
slip, but they don’t come right off the cleat. It looks
more as if some mischievous fool had cast it off for a
joke.”</p>

<p>“But there was no one there,” said I. “The shed was
empty when I examined it, and there was not a soul in
sight on the tow-path.”</p>

<p>“Could you see the shed when you were in the water?”
Thorndyke asked.</p>

<p>“No. My head was below the level of the tow-path.
But if any one had run out and made off, I must have
seen him on the path when I came out. He couldn’t
have got out of sight in the time. Besides, it is incredible
that even a fool should play such a trick as that.”</p>

<p>“It is,” he agreed. “But every explanation seems
incredible. The only plain fact is that it happened. It is
a queer business altogether; and not the least queer
feature in the case is your friend Morris. Hoxton is an
unlikely place for a dealer in antiques, unless he should
happen to deal in other things as well; things, I mean,
of ambiguous ownership.”</p>

<p>“Just what I was thinking,” said Cornish. “Sounds
uncommonly like a fence. However, that is no business
of ours.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Thorndyke, rising and knocking out his
pipe. “And now I must be going. Do you care to walk
with me to the bottom of Doughty-street, Gray?”</p>

<p>I assented at once, suspecting that he had something
to say to me that he did not wish to say before Cornish.
And so it turned out; for as soon as we were outside he
said:</p>

<p>“What I really called about was this: it seems that we
have done the police an injustice. They were more on
the spot than we gave them credit for. I have learned—and
this is in the strictest confidence—that they took that
coin round to the British Museum for the expert’s report.
Then a very curious fact came to light. That coin is
not the original which was stolen. It is an electrotype
in gold, made in two halves very neatly soldered together
and carefully worked on the milled edge to hide the join.
That is extremely important in several respects. In the
first place, it suggests an explanation of the otherwise
incredible circumstance that it was being carried loose
in the waistcoat pocket. It had probably been recently
obtained from the electrotyper. That suggests the
question, is it possible that D’Arblay might have been that
electrotyper? Did he ever work the electrotype process?
We must ascertain whether he did.”</p>

<p>“There is no need,” said I. “It is known to me as a
fact that he did. The little plaquettes that I took for
castings are electrotypes, made by himself. He worked
the process quite a lot, and was very skilful in finishing.
For instance, he did a small bust of his daughter in two
parts and brazed them together.”</p>

<p>“Then, you see, Gray,” said Thorndyke, “that
advances us considerably. We now have a plausible
suggestion as to the motive and a new field of investigation.
Let us suppose that this man employed D’Arblay to make
electrotype copies of certain unique objects with the
intention of disposing of them to collectors. The originals,
being stolen property, would be almost impossible to
dispose of with safety, but a copy would not necessarily
incriminate the owner. But when D’Arblay had made
the copies, he would be a dangerous person, for he would
know who had the originals. Here, to a man whom
we know to be a callous murderer, would be a sufficient
reason for making away with D’Arblay.”</p>

<p>“But do you think that D’Arblay would have
undertaken such a decidedly fishy job? It seems hardly like
him.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Thorndyke. “There was
nothing suspicious about the transaction. The man who
wanted the copies was the owner of the originals, and
D’Arblay would not know or suspect that they were
stolen.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” I admitted. “But you were speaking
of a new field of investigation.”</p>

<p>“Yes. If a number of copies of different objects have
been made, there is a fair chance that some of them have
been disposed of. If they have, and can be traced, they
will give us a start along a new line, which may bring us
in sight of the man himself. Do you ever see Miss
D’Arblay now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” I replied. “I am quite one of the family
at Highgate. I have been there every Sunday lately.”</p>

<p>“Have you!” he exclaimed with a smile. “You are a
pretty locum tenens. However, if you are quite at home
there you can make a few discreet inquiries. Find out,
if you can, whether any electros had been made recently,
and if so, what they were and who was the client. Will
you do that?”</p>

<p>I agreed readily, only too glad to take an active part in
the investigation; and having by this time reached the
end of Doughty-street, I took leave of Thorndyke, and
made my way back to Cornish’s house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X. <br/> Marion’s Peril</h2>

<p>The mist, which had been gathering since the early
afternoon, began to thicken ominously as I approached
Abbey-road, Hornsey, from Crouch End Station,
causing me to quicken my pace so that I might make my
destination before the fog closed in; for this was my first
visit to Marion D’Arblay’s studio, and the neighbourhood
was strange to me. And in fact I was none too soon;
for hardly had I set my hand on the quaint bronze knocker
above the plate inscribed “Mr. J. D’Arblay,” when the
adjoining houses grew pale and shadowy and then
vanished altogether.</p>

<p>My elaborate knock—in keeping with the distinguished
knocker—was followed by soft, quick footsteps, the
sound whereof set my heart ticking in double-quick
time; the door opened, and there stood Miss D’Arblay,
garbed in a most alluring blue smock or pinafore, with
sleeves rolled up to the elbow, with a smile of friendly
welcome on her comely face, and looking so sweet and
charming that I yearned then and there to take her in
my arms and kiss her. This, however being
inadmissible, I shook her hand warmly and was forthwith
conducted through the outer lobby into the main studio,
where I stood looking about me with amused surprise.
She looked at me inquiringly as I emitted an audible
chuckle.</p>

<p>“It is a queer-looking place,” said I; “something
between a miracle-shrine hung with votive offerings from
sufferers who have been cured of sore heads and arms
and legs, and a meat emporium in a cannibal district.”</p>

<p>“It is nothing of the kind!” she exclaimed indignantly.
“I don’t mind the votive offerings, but I reject the
cannibal meat-market as a gross and libellous fiction. But
I suppose it does look rather queer to a stranger.”</p>

<p>“To a what?” I demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>“Oh, I only meant a stranger to the place, of course,
and you know I did. So you needn’t be cantankerous.”</p>

<p>She glanced smilingly round the studio, and for the
first time, apparently, the oddity of its appearance dawned
on her, for she laughed softly and then turned a
mischievous eye on me as I gaped about me like a bumpkin
at a fair. The studio was a very large and lofty room
or hall, with a partially glazed roof and a single large
window just below the skylight. The walls were fitted
partly with rows of large shelves, and the remainder with
ranks of pegs. From the latter hung row after row of
casts of arms, hands, legs, and faces—especially faces—while
the shelves supported a weird succession of heads,
busts, and a few half-length but armless figures. The
general effect was very strange and uncanny, and what
made it more so was the fact that all the heads presented
perfectly smooth, bare craniums.</p>

<p>“Are artists’ models usually bald?” I inquired, as I
noted this latter phenomenon.</p>

<p>“Now you are being foolish,” she replied; “wilfully
and deliberately foolish. You know very well that all
these heads have got to be fitted with wigs; and you
couldn’t fit a wig to a head that already had a fine
covering of plaster curls. But I must admit that it rather
detracts from the beauty of a girl’s head if you represent
it without hair. The models used to hate it when they
were shown with heads like old gentlemen’s, and so did
poor Daddy; in fact, he usually rendered the hair in the
clay, just sketchily, for the sake of the model’s feelings
and his own, and took it off afterwards with a wire
tool. But there is the kettle boiling over. I must make
the tea.”</p>

<p>While this ceremony was being performed I strolled
round the studio and inspected the casts, more particularly
the heads and faces. Of these latter the majority were
obviously modelled, but I noticed a number with closed
eyes, having very much the appearance of death masks.
When we had taken our places at the little table near
the great gas-ring I inquired what they were.</p>

<p>“They do look rather cadaverous, don’t they?” she
said, as she poured out the tea; “but they are not death
masks. They are casts from living faces, mostly from
the faces of models, but my father always used to take
a cast from any one who would let him, They are quite
useful to work from, though, of course, the eyes have to
be put in from another cast or from life.”</p>

<p>“It must be rather an unpleasant operation,” I said,
“having the plaster poured over the face. How does the
victim manage to breathe?”</p>

<p>“The usual plan is to put little tubes or quills into the
nostrils. But my father could keep the nostrils free
without any tubes. He was a very skilful moulder; and then
he always used the best plaster, which set very quickly,
so that it only took a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“And how are you getting on, and what were you
doing when I came in?”</p>

<p>“I am getting on quite well,” she replied. “My work
has been passed as satisfactory, and I have three new
commissions. When you came in I was just getting
ready to make a mould for a head and shoulders. After
tea I shall go on with it, and you shall help me. But
tell me about yourself. You have finished with Dr.
Cornish, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am a gentleman at large for the time being,
but that won’t do. I shall have to look out for another
job.”</p>

<p>“I hope it will be a London job,” she said.
“Arabella and I would feel quite lonely if you went away even
for a week or two. We both look forward so much to our
little family gathering on Sunday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look forward to it as much as I do,” I
said warmly. “It is difficult for me to realize that there
was ever a time when you were not a part of my life.
And yet we are quite new friends.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said; “only a few weeks old. But I have
the same feeling. I seem to have known you for years,
and as for Arabella, she speaks of you as if she had
nursed you from infancy. You have a very insinuating
way with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t spoil it by calling me insinuating!” I
protested.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” she replied. “It was the wrong word.
I meant sympathetic. You have the gift of entering into
other people’s troubles and feeling them as if they were
your own; which is a very precious gift—to the other
people.”</p>

<p>“Your troubles are my own,” said I, “since I have the
privilege to be your friend. But I have been a happier
man since I shared them.”</p>

<p>“It is very nice of you to say that,” she murmured, with
a quick glance at me and just a faint heightening of
colour; and then for a while neither of us spoke.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Dr. Thorndyke lately?” she asked,
when she had refilled our cups, and thereby, as it were,
punctuated our silence.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered. “I saw him only a night or two
ago. And that reminds me that I was commissioned to
make some inquiries. Can you tell me if your father
ever did any electrotype work for outsiders?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she answered. “He used latterly
to electrotype most of his own work instead of sending it
to the bronze-founders, but it is hardly likely that he
would do electros for outsiders. There are firms who
do nothing else, and I know that, when he was busy,
he used to send his work to them. But why do you ask?”</p>

<p>I related to her what Thorndyke had told me, and
pointed out the importance of ascertaining the facts,
which she saw at once.</p>

<p>“As soon as we have finished tea,” she said, “we will
go and look over the cupboard where the electro moulds
were kept—that is, the permanent ones. The gelatine
moulds for works in the round couldn’t be kept. They
were melted down again. But the water-proofed plaster
moulds were stored away in this cupboard, and the
gutta-percha ones, too, until they were wanted to soften down
to make new moulds. And even if the moulds were
destroyed, Father usually kept a cast.”</p>

<p>“Would you be able to tell by looking through the
cupboard?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. I should know a strange mould, of course, as
I saw all the original work that he did. Have we
finished? Then let us go and settle the question now.”</p>

<p>She produced a bunch of keys from her pocket and
crossed the studio to a large, tall cupboard in a corner.
Selecting a key, she inserted it and was trying vainly
to turn it when the door came open. She looked at it
in surprise and then turned to me with a somewhat
puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“This is really very curious,” she said. “When I
came here this morning I found the outer door unlocked.
Naturally I thought I must have forgotten to lock it,
though that would have been an extraordinary oversight.
And now I find this door unlocked. But I distinctly
remember locking it before going away last night, when
I had put back the box of modelling wax. What do
you make of that?”</p>

<p>“It looks as if some one had entered the studio last
night with false keys or by picking the lock. But why
should they? Perhaps the cupboard will tell. You will
know if it has been disturbed.”</p>

<p>She ran her eyes along the shelves and said at once:
“It has been. The things are all in disorder and one of
the moulds is broken. We had better take them all out
and see if anything is missing—so far as I can judge,
that is, for the moulds were just as my father left them.”</p>

<p>We dragged a small work-table to the cupboard and
emptied the shelves one by one. She examined each
mould as we took it out, and I jotted down a rough list
at her dictation. When we had been through the whole
collection and re-arranged the moulds on the shelves—they
were mostly plaques and medallions—she slowly
read through the list and reflected for a few moments.
At length she said:</p>

<p>“I don’t miss anything that I can remember. But the
question is, Were there any moulds or casts that I did
not know about? I am thinking of Dr. Thorndyke’s
question. If there were any, they have gone, so that
question cannot be answered.”</p>

<p>We looked at one another gravely, and in both our
minds was the same unspoken question: “Who was it
that had entered the studio last night?”</p>

<p>We had just closed the cupboard and were moving
away when my eye caught a small object half-hidden in
the darkness under the cupboard itself—the bottom of
which was raised by low feet about an inch and a half
from the floor. I knelt down and passed my hand into
the shallow space and was just able to hook it out. It
proved to be a fragment of a small plaster mould,
saturated with wax and black-leaded on the inside. Miss
D’Arblay stooped over it eagerly and exclaimed: “I don’t
know that one. What a pity it is such a small piece.
But it is certainly part of a coin.”</p>

<p>“It is part of <em>the</em> coin,” said I. “There can be no
doubt of that. I examined the cast that Dr. Thorndyke
made and I recognize this as the same. There is the
lower part of the bust, the letters C A—the first two
letters of Carolus—and the tiny elephant and castle.
That is conclusive. This is the mould from which that
electrotype was made. But I had better hand it to Dr.
Thorndyke to compare with the cast that he has.”</p>

<p>I carefully bestowed the fragment in my tobacco-pouch,
as the safest place for the time being, and
meanwhile Miss D’Arblay looked fixedly at me with a very
singular expression.</p>

<p>“You realize,” she said in a hushed voice, “what this
means. <em>He</em> was in here last night.”</p>

<p>I nodded. The same conclusion had instantly occurred
to me, and a very uncomfortable one it was. There was
something very sinister and horrid in the thought of that
murderous villain quietly letting himself into this studio
and ransacking its hiding-places in the dead of the night.
So unpleasantly suggestive was it that for a time neither
of us spoke a word, but stood looking blankly at one
another in silent dismay. And in the midst of the tense
silence there came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>We both started as if we had been struck. Then Miss
D’Arblay, recovering herself quickly, said: “I had better
go,” and hurried down the studio to the lobby.</p>

<p>I listened nervously, for I was a little unstrung. I
heard her go into the lobby and open the outer door. I
heard a low voice, apparently asking a question; the
outer door closed, and then came a sudden scuffling sound
and a piercing shriek. With a shout of alarm, I raced
down the studio, knocking over a chair as I ran, and
darted into the lobby just as the outer door slammed.</p>

<p>For a moment I hesitated. Miss D’Arblay had shrunk
into a corner, and stood in the semi-darkness with both
her hands pressed tightly to her breast. But she called
out excitedly: “Follow him! I am not hurt”; and on
this I wrenched open the door and stepped out.</p>

<p>But the first glance showed me that pursuit was
hopeless. The fog had now become so dense that I could
hardly see my own feet. I dared not leave the threshold
for fear of not being able to find my way back. Then
she would be alone—and <em>he</em> was probably lurking close
by even now.</p>

<p>I stood irresolute, stock-still; listening intently. The
silence was profound. All the natural noises of a
populous neighbourhood seemed to be smothered by the dense
blanket of dark yellow vapour. Not a sound came to my
ear; no stealthy footfall, no rustle of movement. Nothing
but stark silence.</p>

<p>Uneasily I crept back until the open doorway showed
as a dim rectangle of shadow; crept back and peered
fearfully into the darkness of the lobby. She was still
standing in the corner—an upright smudge of deeper darkness
in the obscurity. But even as I looked, the shadowy
figure collapsed and slid noiselessly to the floor.</p>

<p>In an instant the pursuit was forgotten, and I darted
into the lobby, shutting the outer door behind me, and
dropped on my knees at her side. Where she had fallen
a streak of light came in from the studio, and the sight
that it revealed turned me sick with terror. The whole
front of her smock, from the breast downwards, was
saturated with blood; both her hands were crimson and
gory, and her face was dead-white to the lips.</p>

<p>For an instant I was paralyzed with horror. I could
see no movement of breathing, and the white face with
its parted lips and half-closed eyes, was as the face of
the dead. But when I dared to search for the wound,
I was a little reassured; for, closely as I scrutinized it,
the gory smock showed no sign of a cut excepting on
the bloodstained right sleeve. And now I noticed a deep
gash on the left hand, which was still bleeding freely, and
was probably the source of the blood which had soaked
the smock. There seemed to be no vital wound.</p>

<p>With a deep breath of relief, I hastily tore my
handkerchief into strips and applied the improvised bandage
tightly enough to control the bleeding. Then with the
scissors from my pocket-case, which I now carried from
habit, I laid open the blood-stained sleeve. The wound
on the arm, just above the elbow, was quite shallow; a
glancing wound, which tailed off upwards into a scratch.
A turn of the remaining strip of bandage secured it for
the time being, and this done I once more explored the
front of the smock, pulling its folds tightly apart in
search of the dreaded cut. But there was none; and now,
the bleeding being controlled, it was safe to take measures
of restoration. Tenderly—and not without effort—I
lifted her and carried her into the studio, where was a
shabby but roomy couch, on which poor D’Arblay had
been accustomed to rest when he stayed for the night.
On this I laid her, and fetching some water and a towel,
dabbed her face and neck. Presently she opened her
eyes and heaved a deep sigh, looking at me with a
troubled, bewildered expression, and evidently only
half-conscious. Suddenly her eye caught the great
blood-stain on her smock, and her expression grew wild and
terrified. For a few moments she gazed at me with
eyes full of horror; then, as the memory of her
dreadful experience rushed back on her, she uttered a little
cry and burst into tears, moaning and sobbing almost
hysterically.</p>

<p>I rested her head on my shoulder and tried to
comfort her; and she, poor girl, weak and shaken by the
awful shock, clung to me trembling, and wept
passionately with her face buried in my breast. As for me, I
was almost ready to weep, too, if only from sheer relief
and revulsion from my late terrors.</p>

<p>“Marion, darling!” I murmured into her ear as I
stroked her damp hair. “Poor dear little woman! It
was horrible. But you mustn’t cry any more now. Try
to forget it, dearest.”</p>

<p>She shook her head passionately. “I can never do
that,” she sobbed. “It will haunt me as long as I live.
Oh! and I am so frightened, even now. What a coward
I am!”</p>

<p>“Indeed you are not!” I exclaimed. “You are just
weak from loss of blood. Why did you let me leave
you, Marion?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think I was hurt, and I wasn’t particularly
frightened then; and I hoped that if you followed him
he might be caught. Did you see him?”</p>

<p>“No. There is a thick fog outside. I didn’t dare to
leave the threshold. Were you able to see what he was
like?”</p>

<p>She shuddered and choked down a sob. “He is a
dreadful-looking man,” she said. “I loathed him at the
first glance: a beetle-browed, hook-nosed wretch, with a
face like that of some horrible bird of prey. But I
couldn’t see him very distinctly, for it is rather dark in
the lobby, and he wore a wide-brimmed hat, pulled down
over his brows.”</p>

<p>“Would you know him again? And can you give a
description of him that would be of use to the police?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I should know him again,” she said with
a shudder. “It was a face that one could never forget.
A hideous face! The face of a demon. I can see it now,
and it will haunt me, sleeping and waking, until I die.”</p>

<p>Her words ended with a catch of the breath, and she
looked piteously into my face with wide, terrified eyes. I
took her trembling hand and once more drew her head
to my shoulder.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think that, dear,” said I. “You are all
unstrung now, but these terrors will pass. Try to tell
me quietly just what this man was like. What was his
height, for instance?”</p>

<p>“He was not very tall. Not much taller than I. And
he was rather slightly built.”</p>

<p>“Could you see whether he was dark or fair?”</p>

<p>“He was rather dark. I could see a shock of hair
sticking out from under his hat, and he had a moustache
with turned-up ends and a beard; a rather short beard.”</p>

<p>“And now as to his face. You say he had a hooked
nose?”</p>

<p>“Yes; a great, high-bridged nose like the beak of some
horrible bird. And his eyes seemed to be deep-set under
heavy brows with bushy eyebrows. The face was rather
thin, with high cheek-bones; a fierce, scowling, repulsive
face.”</p>

<p>“And the voice? Should you know that again?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she answered. “He spoke in quite a
low tone, rather indistinctly. And he said only a few
words—something about having come to make some
inquiries about the cost of a wax model. Then he stepped
into the lobby and shut the outer door, and immediately,
without another word, he seized my right arm and struck
at me. But I saw the knife in his hand, and as I called
out I snatched at it with my left hand, so that it missed
my body and I felt it cut my right arm. Then I got hold
of his wrist. But he had heard you coming, and wrenched
himself free. The next moment he had opened the door
and rushed out, shutting it behind him.”</p>

<p>She paused, and then added in a shaking voice: “If
you had not been here—if I had been alone⸺”</p>

<p>“We won’t think of that, Marion. You were not
alone, and you will never be again in this place. I shall
see to that.”</p>

<p>At this she gave a little sigh of satisfaction, and looked
into my face with the pallid ghost of a smile.</p>

<p>“Then I shan’t be frightened any more,” she
murmured; and, closing her eyes, she lay for a while,
breathing quietly as if asleep. She looked very delicate and
frail, with her waxen cheeks and the dark shadows under
her eyes, but still I noted a faint tinge of colour stealing
back into her lips. I gazed down at her with fond anxiety,
as a mother might look at a sleeping child that had just
passed the crisis of a dangerous illness. Of the bare
chance that had snatched her from imminent death I
would not allow myself to think. The horror of that
moment was too fresh for the thought to be endurable.
Instead I began to occupy myself with the practical
question as to how she was to be got home. It was a
long way to North Grove—some two miles I reckoned—too
far for her to walk in her present weak state; and
there was the fog. Unless it lifted it would be
impossible for her to find her way; and I could give her no
help, as I was a stranger to this locality. Nor was it by
any means safe; for our enemy might still be lurking
near, waiting for the opportunity that the fog would offer.</p>

<p>I was still turning over these difficulties when she
opened her eyes and looked up at me a little shyly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ve been rather a baby,” she said, “but
I am much better now. Hadn’t I better get up?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered. “Lie quiet and rest. I am trying
to think how you are to be got home. Didn’t you say
something about a caretaker?”</p>

<p>“Yes; a woman in the little house next door, which
really belongs to the studio. Daddy used to leave the
key with her at night, so that she could clean up. But
I just fetch her in when I want her help. Why do you
ask?”</p>

<p>“Do you think she could get a cab for us?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not. There is no cab-stand anywhere
near here. But I think I could walk, unless the fog is
too thick. Shall we go and see what it is like?”</p>

<p>“I will go,” said I, rising. But she clung to my arm.
“You are not to go alone,” she said, in sudden alarm.
“<em>He</em> may be there still.”</p>

<p>I thought it best to humour her, and accordingly helped
her to rise. For a few moments she seemed rather
unsteady on her feet, but soon she was able to walk,
supported by my arm, to the studio door, which I opened,
and through which wreaths of vapour drifted in. But
the fog was perceptibly thinner; and even as I was
looking across the road at the now faintly visible houses, two
spots of dull yellow light appeared up the road, and my
ear caught the muffled sound of wheels. Gradually the
lights grew brighter, and at length there stole out of the
fog the shadowy form of a cab with a man leading the
horse at a slow walk. Here seemed a chance of escape
from our dilemma.</p>

<p>“Go in and shut the door while I speak to the cabman,”
said I. “He may be able to take us. I shall give four
knocks when I come back.”</p>

<p>She was unwilling to let me go, but I gently pushed
her in and shut the door, and then advanced to meet the
cab. A few words set my anxieties at rest, for it
appeared that the cabman had to set down a fare a little
way along the street, and was very willing to take a
return fare, on suitable terms. As any terms would have
been suitable to me under the circumstances the cabman
was able to make a good bargain, and we parted with
mutual satisfaction and a cordial au revoir. Then I
steered back along the fence to the studio door, on which
I struck four distinct knocks and announced myself
vocally by name. Immediately, the door opened, and a
hand drew me in by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“I am so glad you have come back,” she whispered. “It
was horrid to be alone in the lobby even for a few minutes.
What did the cabman say?”</p>

<p>I told her the joyful tidings, and we at once made
ready for our departure. In a minute or two the welcome
glare of the cab-lamps reappeared, and when I had locked
up the studio and pocketed the key, I helped her into the
rather ramshackle vehicle.</p>

<p>I don’t mind admitting that the cabman’s charges were
extortionate; but I grudged him never a penny. It was
probably the slowest journey that I had ever made, but
yet the funereal pace was all too swift. Half-ashamed
as I was to admit it to myself, this horrible adventure
was bearing sweet fruit to me in the unquestioned
intimacy that had been born in the troubled hour. Little
enough was said; but I sat happily by her side, holding
her uninjured hand in mine (on the pretence of keeping
it warm), blissfully conscious that our sympathy and
friendship had grown to something sweeter and more
precious.</p>

<p>“What are we to say to Arabella?” I asked. “I
suppose she will have to be told?”</p>

<p>“Of course she will,” replied Marion; “you shall tell
her. But,” she added, in a lower tone, “you needn’t tell
her everything—I mean what a baby I was and how you
had to comfort and soothe me. She is as brave as a lion,
and she thinks I am, too. So you needn’t undeceive her
too much.”</p>

<p>“I needn’t undeceive her at all,” said I, “because you
are”; and we were still arguing this weighty question
when the cab drew up at Ivy Cottage. I sent the cabman
off, rejoicing, and then escorted Marion up the path to
the door, where Miss Boler was waiting, having
apparently heard the cab arrive.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” she exclaimed. “I was wondering
how on earth you would manage to get home.” Then
she suddenly observed Marion’s bandaged hand, and
uttered an exclamation of alarm.</p>

<p>“Miss Marion has cut her hand rather badly,” I
explained. “We won’t talk about it just now. I will tell
you everything presently when you have put her to bed.
Now I want some stuff to make dressings and bandages.”</p>

<p>Miss Boler looked at me suspiciously, but made no
comment. With extraordinary promptitude she produced
a supply of linen, warm water, and other necessaries, and
then stood by to watch the operation and give assistance.</p>

<p>“It is a nasty wound,” I said, as I removed the
extemporized dressing, “but not so bad as I feared. There
will be no lasting injury.”</p>

<p>I put on the permanent dressing and then exposed the
wound on the arm, at the sight of which Miss Boler’s
eyebrows went up. But she made no remark; and when
a dressing had been put on this, too, she took charge of
the patient to conduct her up to the bedroom.</p>

<p>“I shall come up and see that she is all right before
I go,” said I, “and meanwhile, no questions, Arabella.”</p>

<p>She cast a significant look at me over her shoulder
and departed with her arm about the patient’s waist.</p>

<p>The rites and ceremonies abovestairs were briefer than
I had expected—perhaps the promised explanations had
accelerated matters. At any rate, in a very few minutes
Miss Boler bustled into the room and said: “You can
go up now, but don’t stop to gossip. I am bursting with
curiosity.”</p>

<p>Thereupon I ascended to my lady’s chamber, which I
entered as diffidently and reverentially as though such
visits were not the commonplace of my professional life.
As I approached the bed she heaved a little sigh of content
and murmured:</p>

<p>“What a fortunate girl I am! To be petted and cared
for and pampered in this way! Arabella is a perfect
angel, and you, Dr. Gray⸺”</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion!” I protested. “Not Dr. Gray.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, Stephen,” she corrected, with a faint blush.</p>

<p>“That is better. And what am I?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she replied, very pink and smiling. “I
expect you know. If you don’t, ask Arabella when you
go down.”</p>

<p>“I expect she will do most of the asking,” said I. “And
I have strict orders not to stop to gossip, so let me see
the bandages, and then I must go.”</p>

<p>I made my inspection without undue hurry, and,
having seen that all was well, I took her hand.</p>

<p>“You are to stay here until I have seen you to-morrow
morning, and you are to be a good girl and try not to
think of unpleasant things.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I will do everything that you tell me.”</p>

<p>“Then I can go away happy. Good night, Marion.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Stephen.”</p>

<p>I pressed her hand and felt her fingers close on mine.
Then I turned away, and with only a moment’s pause
at the door for a last look at the sweet, smiling face,
descended the stairs to confront the formidable Arabella.</p>

<p>Of my cautious statement and her keen cross-examination
I will say nothing. I made the proceedings as short
as was decent, for I wanted, if possible, to take counsel
with Thorndyke. On my explaining this, the brevity of
my account was condoned, and even my refusal of food.</p>

<p>“But remember, Arabella,” I said, as she escorted me
to the gate, “she has had a very severe shock. The less
you say to her about the affair for the present the quicker
will be her recovery.”</p>

<p>With this warning I set forth through the rapidly
thinning fog to catch the first conveyance that I could
find to bear me southward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI. <br/> Arms and the Man</h2>

<p>The fog had thinned to a mere haze when the porter
admitted me at the Inner Temple Gate, so that, as I
passed the Cloisters and looked through into Pump-court
I could see the lighted windows of the residents’ chambers
at the far end. The sight of them encouraged me to hope
that the chambers in King’s Bench-walk might throw out
a similar hopeful gleam. Nor was I disappointed; and
the warm glow from the windows of No. 5a sent me
tripping up the stairs profoundly relieved, though a trifle
abashed at the untimely hour of my visit.</p>

<p>The door was opened by Thorndyke himself, who
instantly cut short my apologies.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Gray!” he exclaimed, shaking my hand.
“It is no interruption at all. On the contrary, how
beautiful upon the staircase are the feet of him that
bringeth—well, what sort of tidings?”</p>

<p>“Not good, I am afraid, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, let us have them. Come and sit by the fire.”
He drew up an easy chair, and, having installed me in it
and taken a critical look at me, invited me to proceed.
I accordingly proceeded bluntly to inform him that an
attempt had been made to murder Miss D’Arblay.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he exclaimed. “These are bad tidings indeed!
I hope she is not injured in any way.”</p>

<p>I reassured him on this point, and gave him the details
as to the patient’s condition, and he then asked:</p>

<p>“When did the attempt occur, and how did you hear
of it?”</p>

<p>“It happened this evening, and I was present.”</p>

<p>“You were present!” he repeated, gazing at me in
the utmost astonishment. “And what became of the
assailant?”</p>

<p>“He vanished into the fog,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. The fog. I had forgotten that. But now
let us drop this question and answer method. Give me
a narrative from the beginning, with the events in their
proper sequence. And omit nothing, no matter how
trivial.”</p>

<p>I took him at his word—up to a certain point. I
described my arrival at the studio, the search in the
cupboard, the sinister interruption, the attack, and the
unavailing attempt at pursuit. As to what befell thereafter
I gave him a substantially complete account—with certain
reservations—up to my departure from Ivy Cottage.</p>

<p>“Then you never saw the man at all?”</p>

<p>“No, but Miss D’Arblay did;” and here I gave him
such details of the man’s appearance as I had been able
to gather from Marion.</p>

<p>“It is quite a vivid description,” he said, as he wrote
down the details; “and now shall we have a look at that
piece of the mould?”</p>

<p>I disinterred it from my tobacco-pouch and handed it
to him. He glanced at it and then went to a cabinet, from
a drawer in which he produced the little case containing
Polton’s casts of the guinea and a box, which he placed on
the table and opened. From it he took a lump of
moulding-wax and a bottle of powdered French chalk.
Pinching off a piece of the wax, he rolled it into a ball, dusted
it lightly with the chalk powder, and pressed it with his
thumb into the mould. It came away on his thumb,
bearing a perfect impression of the inside of the mould.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” said he, taking the obverse cast from
the case and laying it on the table beside the wax
“squeeze.” “The squeeze and the cast are identical.
There is now no possible doubt that the electrotype guinea
that was found in the pond was made by Julius D’Arblay.
Probably it had been delivered by him to the murderer
on the very evening of his death. So we are undoubtedly
dealing with that same man. It is a most alarming
situation.”</p>

<p>“It would be alarming if it were any other man,” I
remarked.</p>

<p>“No doubt,” he agreed. “But there is something very
special about this man. He is a criminal of a type that
is almost unknown here, but is not uncommon in South
European and Slav countries. You find him, too, in the
United States, principally among the foreign-born or alien
population. He is not a normal human being. He is an
inveterate murderer, to whom a human life does not count
at all. And this type of man continually grows more and
more dangerous for two reasons: first, the murder habit
becomes more confirmed with each crime; second, there is
virtually no penalty for the succeeding murders, for the
first one entails the death sentence, and fifty murders can
involve no more. This man killed Van Zellen as a mere
incident of a robbery. Then he appears to have killed
D’Arblay to secure his own safety, and he is now
attempting to kill Miss D’Arblay, apparently for the same
reason. And he will kill you and he will kill me if our
existence is inconvenient or dangerous to him. We must
bear that in mind, and take the necessary measures.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine,” said I, “what motive he can have
for wanting to kill Miss D’Arblay.”</p>

<p>“Probably he believes that she knows something that
would be dangerous to him; something connected with
those moulds, or perhaps something else. We are rather
in the dark. We don’t know for certain what it was he
came to look for when he entered the studio, or whether
or not he found what he wanted. But to return to the
danger. It is obvious that he knows the Abbey-road
district well, for he found his way to the studio in the
fog. He may be living close by. There is no reason
why he should not be. His identity is quite unknown.”</p>

<p>“That is a horrid thought!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It is,” he agreed; “but it is the assumption that we
have to act upon. We must not leave a loop-hole
unwatched. He mustn’t get another chance.”</p>

<p>“No,” I concurred warmly; “he certainly must not—if
we can help it. But it is an awful position. We carry
that poor girl’s life in our hands, and there is always the
possibility that we may be caught off our guard, just for
a moment.”</p>

<p>He nodded gravely. “You are quite right, Gray. An
awful responsibility rests on us. I am very unhappy about
this poor young lady. Of course, there is the other
side—but at present we are concerned with Miss D’Arblay’s
safety.”</p>

<p>“What other side is there?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“I mean,” he replied, “that if we can hold out, this
man is going to deliver himself into our hands.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?” I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“I recognize a familiar phenomenon,” he replied. “My
large experience and extensive study of crimes against the
person have shown me that in the overwhelming majority
of cases of obscure crimes the discovery has been brought
about by the criminal’s own efforts to make himself safe.
He is constantly trying to hide his tracks—and making
fresh ones. Now this man is one of those criminals who
won’t let well alone. He kills Van Zellen and disappears,
leaving no trace. He seems to be quite safe. But he is
not satisfied. He can’t keep quiet. He kills D’Arblay, he
enters the studio, he tries to kill Miss D’Arblay; all to
make himself more safe. And every time he moves he
tells us something fresh about himself. If we can only
wait and watch, we shall have him.”</p>

<p>“What has he told us about himself this time?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“We won’t go into that now, Gray. We have other
business on hand. But you know all that I know as to
the facts. If you will turn over those facts at your
leisure, you will find that they yield some very curious
and striking inferences.”</p>

<p>I was about to press the question when the door opened
and Mr. Polton appeared on the threshold. Observing
me, he crinkled benevolently, and then, in answer to
Thorndyke’s inquiring glance, said: “I thought I had
better remind you, sir, that you have not had any supper.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Polton!” Thorndyke exclaimed, “now you
mention it, I believe you are right. And I suspect that
Dr. Gray is in the same case. So we place ourselves in
your hands. Supper and pistols are what we want.”</p>

<p>“Pistols, sir!” exclaimed Polton, opening his eyes to
an unusual extent and looking at us suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, Polton,” Thorndyke chuckled. “It
isn’t a duel. I just want to go over our stock of pistols
and ammunition.”</p>

<p>At this I thought I detected a belligerent gleam in
Polton’s eye, but even as I looked, he was gone. Not
for long, however. In a couple of minutes he was back
with a large hand-bag which he placed on the table and
again retired. Thorndyke opened the bag and took out
quite a considerable assortment of weapons—single
pistols, revolvers, and automatics—which he laid out on
the table, each with its box of appropriate cartridges.</p>

<p>“I hate fire-arms!” he exclaimed as he viewed the
collection distastefully. “They are dangerous things, and
when it comes to business they are scurvy weapons. Any
poltroon can pull a trigger. But we must put ourselves
on equal terms with our opponent, who is certain to be
provided. Which will you have? I recommend this Baby
Browning for portability. Have you had any practice?”</p>

<p>“Only target practice. But I am a fair shot with a
revolver. I have never used an automatic.”</p>

<p>“We will go over the mechanism after supper,” said he.
“Meanwhile, I hear the approach of Polton and am
conscious of a voracious interest in what he is bringing.
When did you feed last?”</p>

<p>“I had tea at the studio about half-past four.”</p>

<p>“My poor Gray!” he exclaimed, “you must be starving.
I ought to have asked you sooner. However, here comes
relief.” He opened a folding table by the fire just as
Polton entered with the tray, on which I was gratified to
observe a good-sized dish-cover and a claret-jug. Polton
rapidly laid the little table and then, whisking off the
cover, retired with a triumphant crinkle.</p>

<p>“You have a regular kitchen upstairs, I presume,” said
I, as we took our seats at the table, “as well as a
laboratory? And a pretty good cook, too, to judge by the
results.”</p>

<p>Thorndyke chuckled. “The kitchen and the laboratory
are one,” he replied, “and Polton is the cook. An
uncommonly good cook, as you suggest, but his methods are
weird. These cutlets were probably grilled in the cupel
furnace, but I have known him to do a steak with the
brazing-jet. There is nothing conventional about Polton.
But whatever he does, he does to a finish; which is
fortunate, because I thought of calling in his aid in our present
difficulty.”</p>

<p>I looked at him inquiringly, and he continued: “If Miss
D’Arblay is to go on with her work, which she ought to,
as it is her livelihood, she must be guarded constantly.
I had considered applying to Inspector Follett, and we
may have to later; but for the present it will be better
for us to keep our own counsel and play our own hand.
We have two objects in view. First—and paramount—is
the necessity of securing Miss D’Arblay’s safety. But,
second, we want to lay our hands on this man, not to
frighten him away, as we might do if we put the police
on his track. When once we have him, her safety is
secured for ever, whereas if he were merely scared away
he would be an abiding menace. We have got to catch
him, and at present he is catchable. Secure in his
unknown identity, he is lurking within reach, ready to
strike, but also ready to be pounced upon when we are
ready to pounce. Let us keep him confident of his safety
while we are gathering up the clues.”</p>

<p>“H’m—yes,” I assented, without much enthusiasm.
“What is it that you propose to do?”</p>

<p>“Somebody,” he replied, “must keep watch over Miss
D’Arblay from the moment when she leaves her house
until she returns to it. How much time—if any—can
you give up to this duty?”</p>

<p>“My whole time,” I answered promptly. “I shall let
everything else go.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said he, “I propose that you and Polton
relieve one another on duty. It will be better than for you
to be there all the time.”</p>

<p>I saw what he meant, and agreed at once. The
conventions must be respected as far as possible.</p>

<p>“But,” I suggested, “isn’t Polton rather a
light-weight—if it should come to a scrap, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Don’t undervalue small men, even physically,” he
replied. “They are commonly better built than big men
and more enduring and energetic. Polton is remarkably
strong, and he has the pluck of a bulldog. But we must
see how he is placed as regards work.”</p>

<p>The question was put to him and the position of affairs
explained when he came down to clear the table;
whereupon it appeared (from his own account) that he was
absolutely without occupation of any kind and pining for
something to do. Thorndyke laughed incredulously but
did not contest this outrageous and barefaced untruth,
merely remarking:</p>

<p>“I am afraid it will be rather an idle time for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it won’t, sir,” Polton assured him emphatically.
“I’ve always wanted to learn something about
sculptor’s moulding and wax-casting, but I’ve never had
a chance. Now I shall have. And that opportunity isn’t
going to be wasted.”</p>

<p>Thorndyke regarded his assistant with a twinkling eye.
“So it was mere self-seeking that made you so
enthusiastic,” he said. “But you are quite a good moulder
already.”</p>

<p>“Not a sculptor’s moulder, sir,” replied Polton; “and
I know nothing about wax-work. But I shall, before I
have been there many days.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you will,” said Thorndyke. “Miss
D’Arblay will have an apprentice and journeyman in one.
You will be able to give her quite a lot of help; which
will be valuable just now while her hand is disabled.
When do you think she will be able to go back to work,
Gray?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say. Not to-morrow certainly. Shall I send
you a report when I have seen her?”</p>

<p>“Do,” he replied; “or, better still, come in to-morrow
evening and give me the news. So, Polton, we sha’n’t
want you for another day or so.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Polton, “then I shall be able to finish that
recording-clock before I go;” upon which Thorndyke
and I laughed aloud and Polton, his mendacity thus
unmasked, retired with the tray, crinkling but unabashed.</p>

<p>The short remainder of the evening—or rather, of the
night—was spent in the study of the mechanism and mode
of use of automatic pistols. When I finally bestowed the
“Baby,” fully loaded, in my hip-pocket, and rose to go,
Thorndyke sped me on my way with a few words of
warning and advice.</p>

<p>“Be constantly on your guard, Gray. You are going
to make a bitter enemy of a man who knows no scruples;
indeed, you have done so already, and something tells me
that he is aware of it. Avoid all solitary or unfrequented
places. Keep to main thoroughfares and well-lighted
streets, and maintain a diligent look-out for any
suspicious appearances. You have said truly that we carry
Miss D’Arblay’s life in our hands. But to preserve her
life we must preserve our own; which we should probably
prefer to do in any case. Don’t get jumpy—I don’t
much think you will; but keep your attention alert and
your weather eye-lid lifting.”</p>

<p>With these encouraging words and a hearty hand-shake,
he let me out and stood watching me as I descended the
stairs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII. <br/> A Dramatic Discovery</h2>

<p>About eleven o’clock in the forenoon of the third day
after the terrible events of that unforgettable night of
the great fog, Marion and I drew up on our bicycles
opposite the studio door. She was now outwardly quite
recovered, excepting as to her left hand, but I noticed
that, as I inserted the key into the door, she cast a quick,
nervous glance up and down the road; and as we passed
through the lobby, she looked down for one moment at
the great blood-stain on the floor and then hastily averted
her face.</p>

<p>“Now,” I said, assuming a brisk, cheerful tone, “we
must get to work. Mr. Polton will be here in half an
hour and we must be ready to put his nose on the
grindstone at once.”</p>

<p>“Then your nose will have to go on first,” she replied
with a smile, “and so will mine, with two raw apprentices
to teach and an important job waiting to be done. But,
dear me! what a lot of trouble I am giving!”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind, Marion,” I exclaimed; “you are
a public benefactor. Polton is delighted at the chance
to come here and enlarge his experience, and as for
me⸺”</p>

<p>“Well? As for you?” She looked at me half-shyly,
half-mischievously. “Go on. You’ve stopped at the most
interesting point.”</p>

<p>“I think I had better not,” said I. “We don’t want
the forewoman to get too uppish.”</p>

<p>She laughed softly, and when I had helped her out of
her overcoat and rolled up the sleeve of her one serviceable
arm, I went out to the lobby to stow away the bicycles
and lock the outer door. When I returned, she had got
out from the cupboard a large box of flaked gelatine and
a massive spouted bucket which she was filling at the
sink.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better explain to me what we are going
to do?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, explanations are of no use,” she replied. “You
just do as I tell you and then you will know all about it.
This isn’t a school; it’s a workshop. When we have got
the gelatine in to soak, I will show you how to make a
plaster case.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” I retorted, “that my instructress has
graduated in the academy of Squeers. ‘W-i-n-d-e-r
winder; now go and clean one.’ Isn’t that the method?”</p>

<p>“Apprentices are not allowed to waste time in
wrangling,” she rejoined, severely. “Go and put on
one of Daddy’s blouses and I will set you to work.”</p>

<p>This practical method of instruction justified itself
abundantly. The reasons for each process emerged at
once as soon as the process was completed. And it was
withal a pleasant method, for there is no comradeship
so sympathetic as the comradeship of work; nor any which
begets so wholesome and friendly an intimacy. But
though there were playful and frivolous interludes—as
when the forewoman’s working hand became encrusted
with clay and had to be cleansed with a sponge by the
apprentice—we worked to such purpose that by the time
Mr. Polton was due, the plaster bust (of which a wax
replica was to be made) was firmly fixed on the
work-table on a clay foundation and surrounded by a
carefully levelled platform of clay, in which it was embedded
to half its thickness. I had just finished smoothing the
surface when there came a knock at the outer door; on
which Marion started violently and clutched my arm.
But she recovered in a moment, and exclaimed in a tone
of vexation:</p>

<p>“How silly I am! Of course, it is Mr. Polton.”</p>

<p>It was. I found him on the threshold in rapt
contemplation of the knocker, and looking rather like an
archdeacon on tour. He greeted me with a friendly
crinkle and I then conducted him into the studio and
presented him to Marion, who shook his hand warmly and
thanked him so profusely for coming to her aid that he
was quite abashed. However, he did not waste time in
compliments, but, producing an apron from his hand-bag,
took off his coat, donned the apron, rolled up so sleeves,
and beamed inquiringly at the bust.</p>

<p>“We are going to make a plaster case for the gelatine
mould, Mr. Polton,” Marion explained, and proceeded to
a few preliminary directions, to which the new apprentice
listened with respectful attention. But she had hardly
finished when he fell to work with a quiet, unhurried
facility that filled me with envy. He seemed to know
where to find everything. He discovered the waste-paper
with which to cover the model to prevent the clay from
sticking to it, he pounced on the clay bin at the first shot,
and when he had built up the shape for the case, found
the plaster-bin, mixing-bowl, and spoon as if he had been
born and bred in the workshop, stopping only for a
moment to test the condition of the gelatine in the bucket.</p>

<p>“Mr. Polton,” Marion said, after watching him for a
while, “you are an impostor—a dreadful impostor. You
pretend to come here as an improver, but you really know
all about gelatine moulding; now, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Polton admitted apologetically that he “had done a
little in that way. But,” he added, in extenuation, “I
have never done any work in wax. And, talking of wax,
the doctor will be here presently.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Thorndyke?” Marion asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss. He had some business in Holloway, so
he thought he would come on here to make your
acquaintance and take a look at the premises.”</p>

<p>“All the same, Mr. Polton,” said I, “I don’t quite see
the connexion between Dr. Thorndyke and wax.”</p>

<p>He crinkled with a slightly embarrassed air and
explained that he must have been thinking of something that
the doctor had said to him; but his explanations were cut
short by a knock at the door.</p>

<p>“That is his knock,” said Polton; and he and I
together proceeded to open the door, when I inducted the
distinguished visitor into the studio and presented him
to the presiding goddess. I noticed that each of them
inspected the other with some curiosity, and that the first
impressions appeared to be mutually satisfactory, though
Marion was at first a little overawed by Thorndyke’s
impressive personality.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t let me interrupt your work,” the latter
said, when the preliminary politenesses had been
exchanged. “I have just come to fill in Dr. Gray’s outline
sketches with details of my own observing. I wanted
to see you—to convert a name into an actual person, to
see the studio for the same reason, and to get as precise
a description as possible of the man whom we are trying
to identify. Will it distress you to recall his appearance?”</p>

<p>She had turned a little pale at the mention of her late
assailant, but she answered stoutly enough: “Not at all;
besides, it is necessary.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said he; “then I will read out the
description that I had from Dr. Gray, and we will see if
you can add anything to it.”</p>

<p>He produced a note-book, from which he read out the
particulars that I had given him, at the conclusion of
which he looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I think that is all that I remember,” she said. “There
was very little light, and I really only glanced at him.”</p>

<p>Thorndyke looked at her reflectively. “It is a fairly
full description,” said he. “Perhaps the nose is a little
sketchy. You speak of a hooked nose with a high bridge.
Was it a curved nose of the Jewish type, or a squarer,
Roman nose?”</p>

<p>“It was rather square in profile; a Wellington nose,
but with a rather broad base. Like a vulture’s beak, and
very large.”</p>

<p>“Was it actually a hook-nose? I mean, had it a
drooping tip?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the tip projected downwards and it was rather
sharp—not bulbous.”</p>

<p>“And the chin? Should you call it a pronounced or
a retreating chin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was quite a projecting chin, rather of the
Wellington type.”</p>

<p>Thorndyke reflected once more; then, having jotted
down the answers to his questions, he closed the book and
returned it to his pocket.</p>

<p>“It is a great thing to have a trained eye,” he
remarked. “In your one glance you saw more than an
ordinary person would have noted in a leisurely
inspection in a good light. You have no doubt that you would
know this man again if you should meet him?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest,” she replied, with a shudder. “I
can see him now if I shut my eyes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he rejoined, with a smile, “I wouldn’t recall
that unpleasant vision too often, if I were you. And
now, may I, without disturbing you further, just take a
look round the premises?”</p>

<p>“But, of course, Dr. Thorndyke,” she replied. “Do
exactly what you please.”</p>

<p>With this permission, he drew away and stood for
some moments letting a very reflective eye travel round
the interior; and meanwhile I watched him curiously and
wondered what he had really come for. His first
proceeding was to walk slowly round the studio and examine
closely, one by one, all the casts which hung on pegs.
Next, in the same systematic manner, he inspected all the
shelves, mounting a chair to examine the upper ones. It
was after scrutinizing one of the latter that he turned
towards Marion and asked:</p>

<p>“Have you moved these casts lately, Miss D’Arblay?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied; “so far as I know, they have not
been touched for months.”</p>

<p>“Some one has moved them within the last day or
two,” said he. “Apparently the nocturnal explorer went
over the shelves as well as the cupboard.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why,” said Marion. “There were no
moulds on the shelves.”</p>

<p>Thorndyke made no rejoinder, but as he stood on the
chair he once more ran his eye round the studio.
Suddenly he stepped down from the chair, picked it up,
carried it over to the tall cupboard, and once more mounted
it. His stature enabled him easily to look over the cornice
on to the top of the cupboard, and it was evident that
something there had attracted his attention.</p>

<p>“Here is a derelict of some sort,” he announced, “which
certainly has not been moved for some months.” As he
spoke, he reached over the cornice into the enclosed
space and lifted out an excessively grimy plaster mask,
from which he blew the thick coating of dust, and then
stood for a while looking at it thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“A striking face this,” he remarked, “but not
attractive. It rather suggests a Russian or Polish Jew; do you
recognize the person, Miss D’Arblay?”</p>

<p>He stepped down from the chair, and handed the mask
to Marion, who had advanced to look at it, and who now
held it in her hand regarding it with a frown of
perplexity.</p>

<p>“This is very curious,” she said. “I thought I knew
all the casts that have been made here. But I have never
seen this one before, and I don’t know the face. I wonder
who he was. It doesn’t look like an English face, but
I should hardly have taken it for the face of a Jew, with
that rather small and nearly straight nose.”</p>

<p>“The East-European Jews are not a very pure breed,”
said Thorndyke. “You will see many a face of that type
in Whitechapel High-street and the Jewish quarters
hard by.”</p>

<p>At this point, deserting the work-table, I came and
looked over Marion’s shoulder at the mask which she was
holding at arm’s length. And then I got a surprise of
the most singular kind, for I recognized the face at a
glance.</p>

<p>“What is it, Gray?” asked Thorndyke, who had
apparently observed my astonishment.</p>

<p>“This is the most extraordinary coincidence!” I
exclaimed. “Do you remember my speaking to you about
a certain Mr. Morris?”</p>

<p>“The dealer in antiques?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, this is his face.”</p>

<p>He regarded me for some moments with a strangely
intent expression. Then he asked: “When you say that
this is Morris’ face, do you mean that it resembles his
face, or that you identify it positively?”</p>

<p>“I identify it positively. I can swear to the identity.
It isn’t a face that one would forget. And if any doubt
were possible, there is this hare-lip scar, which you can
see quite plainly on the cast.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed that. And Morris has a hare-lip scar,
hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and in the same position and of the same character.
I think you can take it as a fact that this cast was
undoubtedly taken from Morris’ face.”</p>

<p>“Which,” said Thorndyke, “is a really important fact
and one that is worth looking into.”</p>

<p>“In what way is it important?” I asked.</p>

<p>“In this respect,” he answered. “This man, Morris,
is unknown to Miss D’Arblay; but he was not unknown
to her father. Here we have evidence that Mr. D’Arblay
had dealings with people of whom his daughter had no
knowledge. The circumstances of the murder made it
clear that there must be such people; but here we have
proof of their existence, and we can give to one of them
‘a local habitation and a name.’ And you will notice that
this particular person is a dealer in curios and possibly
in more questionable things. There is just a hint that
he may have had some rather queer acquaintances.”</p>

<p>“He seemed to have had rather a fancy for plaster
masks,” I remarked. “I remember that he had one in
his shop window.”</p>

<p>“Did your father make many life or death masks as
commissions, Miss D’Arblay?” Thorndyke asked.</p>

<p>“Only one or two, so far as I know,” she replied.
“There is very little demand for portrait masks nowadays.
Photography has superseded them.”</p>

<p>“That is what I should have supposed,” said he. “This
would be just a chance commission. However, as it
establishes the fact that this man Morris was in some
way connected with your father, I think I should like to
have a record of his appearance. May I take this mask
away with me to get a photograph of it made? I will
take great care of it, and let you have it back safely.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Marion; “but why not keep it,
if it is of any interest to you? I have no use for it.”</p>

<p>“That is very good of you,” said he; “and if you will
give me some rag and paper to pack it in, I will take
myself off, and leave you to finish your work in peace.”</p>

<p>Marion took the cast from him, and, having procured
some rag and paper, began very carefully to wrap it up.
While she was thus engaged, Thorndyke stood, letting his
eye travel once more round the studio.</p>

<p>“I see,” he remarked, “that you have quite a number
of masks moulded from life, or death. Do I understand
that they were not commissions?”</p>

<p>“Very few of them were,” Marion replied. “Most
of them were taken from professional models, but some
from acquaintances whom my father bribed with the
gift of a duplicate mask.”</p>

<p>“But why did he make them? They could not have
been used for producing wax faces for the show figures;
for you could hardly turn a shop window into a wax-work
exhibition with lifelike portraits of real persons.”</p>

<p>“No,” Marion agreed, “that wouldn’t do at all. These
masks were principally used for reference as to details of
features when my father was modelling a head in clay.
But he did sometimes make moulds for the wax from
these masks, only he obliterated the likeness, so that the
wax face was not a portrait.”</p>

<p>“By working on the wax, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes; or more usually by altering the mask before
making the mould. It is quite easy to alter a face. Let
me show you.”</p>

<p>She lifted one of the masks from its peg and laid it
on the table.</p>

<p>“You see,” she said, “that this is the face of a young
girl—one of my father’s models. It is a round, smooth,
smiling face, with a very short, weak chin and a
projecting upper lip. We can change all that in a moment.”</p>

<p>She took up a lump of clay and, pinching off a pellet,
laid it on the right cheek-bone and spread it out. Having
treated the other side in the same manner, she rolled an
elongated pellet, with which she built up the lower lip.
Then, with a larger pellet, she enlarged the chin
downwards and forwards, and, having added a small touch
to each of the eyebrows, she dipped a sponge in thick
clay-water, or “slip,” and dabbed the mask all over to
bring it to a uniform colour.</p>

<p>“There,” she said, “it is very rough, but you see what
I mean.”</p>

<p>The result was truly astonishing. The weak, chubby,
girlish face had been changed by these few touches into
the strong, coarse face of a middle-aged woman.</p>

<p>“It really is amazing!” I exclaimed. “It is a perfectly
different face. I wouldn’t have believed that such a thing
was possible.”</p>

<p>“It is a most striking and interesting demonstration,”
said Thorndyke. “But yet I don’t know that we need
be so surprised. If we consider that of all the millions
of persons in this island alone each one has a face which
is different from any other, and yet that all those faces
are made up of the same anatomical parts, we realize
that the differences which distinguish one face from
another must be excessively subtle and minute.”</p>

<p>“We do,” agreed Marion, “especially when we are
modelling a portrait bust and the likeness won’t come
although every part appears to be correct and all the
measurements seem to agree. A true likeness is an
extraordinarily subtle and exact piece of work.”</p>

<p>“So I have always thought,” said Thorndyke. “But
I mustn’t delay you any longer. May I have my precious
parcel?”</p>

<p>Marion handed him the not very presentable bundle with
a smile and a bow. He then took his leave of her and I
escorted him to the door, where he paused for a moment
as we shook hands.</p>

<p>“You are bearing my advice in mind, I hope, Gray,”
he said.</p>

<p>“As to keeping clear of unfrequented places? Yes, I
have been very careful in that respect, and I never go
abroad without the pistol. It is in my hip-pocket now.
But I have seen no sign of anything to justify so much
caution. I doubt if our friend is even aware of my
existence, and in any case, I don’t see that he has
anything against me, excepting as Miss D’Arblay’s
watch-dog.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure, Gray,” he rejoined earnestly.
“There may be certain little matters that you have
overlooked. At any rate, don’t relax your caution. Give
all unfrequented places a wide berth and keep a bright
look-out.”</p>

<p>With this final warning, he turned away and strode off
down the road while I re-entered the studio just in time
to see Polton mix the first bowl of plaster, as Marion,
having washed the clay from the transformed mask,
dried it and rehung it on its peg.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII. <br/> A Narrow Escape</h2>

<p>The statement that I had made to Thorndyke was
perfectly true in substance; but it was hardly as
significant in fact as the words implied. I had, it is true, in my
journeyings abroad, restricted myself to well-beaten
thoroughfares. But then I had had no occasion to do
otherwise. Until Polton’s arrival on the scene my time had
been wholly taken up in keeping a watch on Marion; and
so it would have continued if I had followed my own
inclination. But at the end of the first day’s work she
intervened resolutely.</p>

<p>“I am perfectly ashamed,” she said, “to occupy the
time of two men, both of whom have their own affairs
to attend to, though I can’t tell you how grateful I am
to you for sacrificing yourselves.”</p>

<p>“We are acting under the doctor’s orders, Miss,” said
Polton, thereby, in his opinion, closing the subject.</p>

<p>“You mean Dr. Thorndyke’s?” said Marion, not
realizing—or not choosing to realize—that, to Polton,
there was no other doctor in the world who counted.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss. The doctor’s orders must be carried out.”</p>

<p>“Of course they must,” she agreed warmly, “since
he has been so very good as to take all this trouble about
my safety. But there is no need for both of you to be
here together. Couldn’t you arrange to take turns on
duty—alternate days or a half-day each? I hate the
thought that I am wasting the whole of both your times.”</p>

<p>I did not look on the suggestion with favour, for I was
reluctant to yield up to any man—even to Polton—the
privilege of watching over the safety of one who was so
infinitely dear to me. Nor was Polton much less
unwilling to agree, for he loathed to leave a piece of work
uncompleted. However, Marion refused to accept our
denials (as is the way of women), and the end of it was
that Polton and I had to arrange our duties in half-day
shifts, changing over at the end of each week, the first
spell allotting the mornings to me and the latter half of the
day—with the duty of seeing Marion home—to him.</p>

<p>Thus, during each of the following six working days,
I found myself with the entire afternoon and evening
free. The former I usually spent at the hospital, but in
the evenings, feeling too unsettled for study, I occupied
myself very pleasantly with long walks through the
inexhaustible streets, extending my knowledge of the town
and making systematic explorations of such distant
regions as Mile End, Kingsland, Dalston, Wapping, and
the Borough.</p>

<p>One evening I bethought me of my promise to look
in on Usher. I did not find myself yearning for his
society, but a promise is a promise. Accordingly, when
I had finished my solitary dinner, I set forth from my
lodgings in Camden-square and made a bee-line for
Clerkenwell: so far, that is to say, as was possible, while
keeping to the wider streets. For in this respect, I
followed Thorndyke’s instructions to the letter, though, as to
the other matter—that of keeping a bright look-out—I
was less attentive, my mind being much more occupied
with thoughts of Marion (who would, just now, be on
her way home under Polton’s escort) than with any
considerations of my own personal safety. Indeed, to
tell the truth, I was inclined to be more than a little
sceptical as to the need for these extraordinary
precautions.</p>

<p>I found Usher in the act of bowing out the last of the
“evening consultations,” and was welcomed by him with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Delighted to see you, old chap!” he exclaimed,
shaking my hand warmly. “It is good of you to drop in on
an old fossil like me. Didn’t much think you would. I
suppose you don’t often come this way?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied. “It is rather off my beat. I’ve
finished with Hoxton—for the present, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” said Usher, “since poor old Crile went
off to the better land.”</p>

<p>“Crile?” I repeated. “Who was he?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember my telling you about his
funeral, when they had those Sunday-school kids yowling
hymns round the grave? That was Mr. Crile—Christian
name, Jonathan.”</p>

<p>“I remember; but I didn’t realize that he was a Hoxton
aristocrat.”</p>

<p>“Well, he was. Fifty-two, Field-street was his earthly
abode. I used to remember it by the number of weeks
in the year. And glad enough I was when he hopped off
his perch, for his confounded landlady, a Mrs. Pepper,
would insist on fixing the times for my visits, and deuced
inconvenient times, too. Between four and six on
Tuesdays and Fridays. I hate patients who turn your visits
into appointments. Upsets your whole visiting-list.”</p>

<p>“It seems to be the fashion in Hoxton,” I remarked.
“I had to make my visits at appointed times, too. It
would have been frightfully inconvenient if I had been
busy. Is it often done?”</p>

<p>“They will always do it if you let ’em. Of course, it
is a convenience to a woman who doesn’t keep a servant,
to know what time the doctor is going to call; but it
doesn’t do to give way to ’em.”</p>

<p>I assented to this excellent principle, noting, however,
that he seemed to have “given way to ’em,” all the same.</p>

<p>As we had been talking, we had gradually drifted
from the surgery up a flight of stairs to a shabby, cosy
little room on the first floor, where a cheerful fire was
burning and a copper kettle on a trivet purred contentedly
and breathed forth little clouds of steam. Usher inducted
me into a large easy chair, the depressed seat of which
suggested its customary use by an elephant of sedentary
habits, and produced from a cupboard a spirit decanter,
a high-shouldered Dutch gin-bottle, a sugar-basin, and
a couple of tumblers and sugar-crushers.</p>

<p>“Whisky or Hollands?” he demanded; and, as curiosity
led me to select the latter, he commented: “That’s
right, Gray. Good stuff, Hollands. Touches up the
cubical epithelium—what! I am rather partial to a drop
of Hollands.”</p>

<p>It was no empty profession. The initial dose made
me open my eyes; and that was only a beginning. In a
twinkling, as it seemed, his tumbler was empty and the
collaboration of the bottle and the copper kettle was
repeated. And so it went on for nearly an hour, until I
began to grow quite uneasy, though without any visible
cause, so far as Usher was concerned. He did not turn
a hair (he hadn’t very many to turn, for that matter,
but I speak figuratively). The only effect that I could
observe was an increasing fluency of speech with a
tendency to discursiveness; and I must admit that his
conversation was highly entertaining. But his evident
intention to “make a night of it” set me planning to make
my escape without appearing to slight his hospitality.
How I should have managed it, unaided by the direct
interposition of Providence, I cannot guess: for his
conversation had now taken the form of an interminable
sentence punctuated by indistinguishable commas; but in
the midst of this steadily flowing stream of eloquence
the outer silence was rent by the sudden jangling of a
bell.</p>

<p>Usher stopped short, stared at me solemnly, deliberately
emptied his tumbler, and stood up.</p>

<p>“Night bell, ol’ chappie,” he explained. “Got to go
out. But don’t you disturb yourself. Back in a few
minutes. Soon polish ’em off.”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk round with you as far as your patient’s
house,” said I, “and then I shall have to get home. It is
past ten and I have a longish walk to Camden-square.”</p>

<p>He was disposed to argue the point, but another violent
jangling cut his protests short and sent him hurrying
down the stairs with me close at his heels. A couple of
minutes later we were out in the street, following in the
wake of a hurrying figure; and, looking at Usher as he
walked sedately at my side, with his top-hat, his whiskers,
and his inevitable umbrella, I had the feeling that all
those jorums of Hollands had been consumed in vain.
In appearance, in manner, in speech, and in gait, he was
just his normal self, with never a hint of any change
from the status quo ante bellum.</p>

<p>Our course led us into the purlieus of St. John
Street-road, where we presently turned into a narrow, winding,
and curiously desolate little street, along which we
proceeded for a few hundred yards, when our “fore-runner”
halted at a door into which he inserted a latch-key. When
we arrived at the open door, inside which a shadowy
figure was lurking, Usher stopped and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Good night, old chap,” he said. “Sorry you can’t
come back with me. If you keep straight on and turn
to the left at the cross-roads you will come out presently
into the King’s Cross-road. Then you’ll know your
way. So long.”</p>

<p>He turned into the dark passage, the door was closed,
and I went on my way.</p>

<p>The little meandering street was singularly silent and
deserted; and its windings cut off the light from the
scanty street-lamps so that stretches of it were in almost
total darkness. As I strode forward, the echoes of my
footfalls resounded with hollow reverberations which
smote my ear—and ought to have smitten my
conscience—causing me to wonder, with grim amusement, what
Thorndyke would have said if he could have seen me
thus setting his instructions at defiance. Indeed, I was
so far sensible of the impropriety of my being in such a
place at such an hour that I was about to turn to take a
look back along the street; but at the very moment that I
halted within a few feet of a street-lamp, something struck
the brim of my hat with a sharp, weighty blow like the
stroke of a hammer, and I heard a dull thud from the
lamp-post.</p>

<p>In an instant I spun round, mighty fierce, whipping
out my pistol, cocking it, and pointing it down the street
as I raced back towards the spot from whence the missile
had appeared to come. There was not a soul in sight nor
any sound of movement, and the shallow doorways
seemed to offer no possible hiding place. But some
thirty yards back I came suddenly on a narrow
opening like an empty doorway, but actually the entrance
to a covered alley not more than three feet wide
and as dark as a pocket. This was evidently the
ambush (which I had passed, like a fool, without
observing it), and I halted beside it, with my pistol still
pointed, listening intently and considering what I had
better do. My first impulse had been to charge into the
alley, but a moment’s reflection showed the futility of such
a proceeding. Probably my assailant had made off by
some well-known outlet; but in any case it would be sheer
insanity for me to plunge into that pitch-dark passage.
For if he were still lurking there he would be invisible to
me, whereas I should be a clear silhouette against the dim
light of the street. Moreover, I had seen no one, and I
could not shoot at any chance stranger whom I might
find there. Reluctantly I recognized that there was
nothing for it but to retreat cautiously and be more careful
in future.</p>

<p>My retirement would have looked an odd proceeding
to an observer, if there had been one, for I had to retreat
crab-wise in order that I might keep the entrance of the
alley covered with my pistol and yet see where I was
going. When I reached the lamp-post I scanned the area
of lighted ground beneath it, and, almost at the first
glance, perceived an object like a largish marble lying
in the road. It proved, when I picked it up, to be a leaden
ball, like an old-fashioned musket-ball, with one flattened
side, which had prevented it from rolling away from the
spot where it had fallen. I dropped it into my pocket
and resumed my masterly retreat until, at length, the
cross-roads came into view. Then I quickened my pace,
and as I reached the corner put away my pistol after
slipping in the safety catch.</p>

<p>Once more out in the lighted and frequented main
streets, my thoughts were free to turn over this
extraordinary experience. But I did not allow them to divert
me from a very careful look-out. All my scepticism
was gone now. I realized that Thorndyke had not been
making mere vague guesses, but that he had clearly
foreseen that something of this kind would probably happen.
That was, to me, the most perplexing feature of this
incomprehensible affair.</p>

<p>I turned it over in my mind again and again, and
could make nothing of it. I could see no adequate reason
why this man should want to make away with me. True,
I was Marion’s protector; but that—even if he were
aware of it—did not seem an adequate reason. Indeed,
I could not see why he was seeking to make away with
her—nor, even, was it clear to me that there had been a
reasonable motive for murdering her father. But as
to myself, I seemed to be out of the picture altogether.
The man had nothing to fear from me or to gain by my
death.</p>

<p>That was how it appeared to me; and yet I saw plainly
that I must be mistaken. There must be something
behind all this—something that was unknown to me but
was known to Thorndyke. What could it be? I found
myself unable to make any sort of guess. In the end,
I decided to call on Thorndyke the following evening,
report the incident, and see if I could get any
enlightenment from him.</p>

<p>The first part of this programme I carried out
successfully enough, but the second presented more
difficulties.</p>

<p>Thorndyke was not a very communicative man, and
a perfectly impossible one to pump. What he chose to
tell he told freely; and beyond that, no amount of
ingenuity could extract the faintest shadow of a hint.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I am disturbing you, Sir,” I said in
some alarm, as I noted a portentous heap of documents
on the table.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied. “I have nearly finished, and I shall
treat you as a friend, and keep you waiting while I do
the little that is left.” He turned to his papers and took
up his pen, but paused to cast one of his quick,
penetrating glances at me.</p>

<p>“Has anything fresh happened?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Our unknown friend has had a pot at me,” I
answered. “That is all.”</p>

<p>He laid down his pen, and leaning back in his chair,
demanded particulars. I gave him an account of what
had happened on the preceding night, and, taking the
leaden ball from my pocket, laid it on the table. He
picked it up, examined it curiously, and then placed it on
the letter balance.</p>

<p>“Just over half an ounce,” he said. “It is a mercy
it missed your head. With that weight and the velocity
indicated by the flattening, it would have dropped you
insensible with a fractured skull.”</p>

<p>“And then he would have come along and put the
finishing touches, I suppose. But I wonder how he shot
the thing. Could he have used an air gun?”</p>

<p>Thorndyke shook his head. “An air gun that would
discharge a ball of that weight would make quite a loud
report, and you say you heard nothing. You are quite
sure of that, by the way?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. The place was as silent as the grave.”</p>

<p>“Then he must have used a catapult; and an
uncommonly efficient weapon it is in skilful hands, and as
portable as a pistol. You mustn’t give him another
chance, Gray.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to, if I can help it. But what the
deuce does the fellow want to pot at me for? It is a
most mysterious thing. Do you understand what it is all
about, Sir?”</p>

<p>“I do not,” he replied. “My knowledge of the facts
of this case is nearly all second-hand knowledge, derived
from you. You know all that I know and probably
more.”</p>

<p>“That is all very well, Sir,” said I; “but you foresaw
that this was likely to happen. I didn’t. Therefore you
must know more about the case than I do.”</p>

<p>He chuckled softly. “You are confusing knowledge
and inference,” said he. “We had the same facts, but
our inferences were not the same. It is just a matter
of experience. You haven’t squeezed out of the facts as
much as they are capable of yielding. Come, now, Gray;
while I am finishing my work you shall look over my
notes of this case, and then you should take a sort of
bird’s-eye view of the whole case, and see if anything
new occurs to you. And you must add to those notes
that this man has been at the enormous trouble of
stalking you continuously, that he shadowed you to Usher’s,
that he waited patiently for you to come out, that he
followed you most skilfully, and took instant advantage
of the first opportunity that you gave him. You might
also note that he did not elect to overtake you and make
a direct attack on you, as he did on Miss D’Arblay.
Note those facts, and consider what their significance
may be. And now just go through this little dossier.
It won’t take you many minutes.”</p>

<p>He took out of a drawer a small portfolio, on the cover
of which was written, “J. D’Arblay, dec’d.,” and, passing
it to me, returned to his documents. I opened it and
found it to contain a number of separate abstracts, each
duly headed with its descriptive title, and an envelope
marked, “Photographs.” Glancing over the abstracts,
I saw that they dealt respectively with J. D’Arblay, The
Inquest, The Van Zellen Case, Miss D’Arblay, Dr. Gray,
and Mr. Morris; the last containing, somewhat to my
surprise, all the details that I had given Thorndyke
respecting that rather mysterious person, together with an
account of my dealings with him and cross-references
to the abstract bearing my name. It was all very
complete and methodical, but none of the abstracts contained
any information that was new to me. If this
represented all the facts that were known to Thorndyke, then
he was no better informed than I was. But he had
evidently got a great deal more out of the information than
I had.</p>

<p>Returning the abstracts with some disappointment to
the portfolio, I turned to the photographs; and then I
got a very thorough surprise. There were only three,
and the first two were of no great interest, one
representing the two casts of the guinea and the other the
plaster mask of Morris. But the third fairly took away
my breath. It was a very bad photograph, apparently
an enlargement from a rather poor snap-shot portrait;
but, bad as it was, it gave a very vivid presentment of
one of the most evil-looking faces that I have ever looked
on; a lean, bearded face, with high cheek-bones, with
heavy, frowning brows that overhung deep-shadowed,
hollow eye-sockets and an almost grotesquely large nose,
thin, curved, and sharp, that jutted out like a great
predatory beak.</p>

<p>I stared at the photograph in speechless amazement.
At the first glance I had been struck by the perfect way
in which this crude portrait realized Marion’s description
of the man who had tried to murder her. But that was
not all. There was another resemblance which I now
perceived with even more astonishment; indeed, it was
so incredible that the perception of it reduced me to
something like stupefaction. I sat for fully a minute
with the portrait in my hand, and my thoughts surging
confusedly in a vain effort to grasp the meaning of this
extraordinary likeness; then, happening to glance up at
Thorndyke, I found him quietly regarding me with
undisguised interest.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, as he caught my eye.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” I demanded, holding up the photograph.</p>

<p>“That is what I want to know,” he replied. “The
photograph came to me without any description. The
identity of the subject is unknown. Who do you think
he is?”</p>

<p>“To begin with,” I answered, “he exactly corresponds
in appearance with Miss D’Arblay’s description of her
would-be murderer. Don’t you think so?’</p>

<p>“I do,” he replied. “The correspondence seems
complete in every detail, so far as I can judge. That was
why I secured the photograph. But the actual
resemblance will have to be settled by her. I suggest that you
take the portrait and let her see it; but you had better
not show it to her pointedly for identification. It would
be better to put it in some place where she will see it
without previous suggestion or preparation. But you
said just now ‘to begin with.’ Was there anything else
that struck you about this photograph?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered, “there was; a most amazing thing.
You remember my telling you about the patient I
attended in Morris’ house?”</p>

<p>“The man who died of gastric cancer and was
eventually cremated?”</p>

<p>“Yes. His name was Bendelow. Well, this
photograph might have been a portrait of Bendelow, taken
with a beard and moustache before the disease got hold
of him. Excepting for the emaciation and the
beard—Bendelow was clean-shaved—I should think it would be
quite an excellent likeness of him.”</p>

<p>Thorndyke made no immediate reply or comment,
but sat quite still, looking at me with a very singular
expression. I could see that he was thinking rapidly and
intensely, but I suspected that his thoughts were in a good
deal less confusion than mine had been.</p>

<p>“It is,” he remarked at length, “as you say, a most
amazing affair. The face is no ordinary face. It would
be difficult to mistake it, and one would have to go far
to find another with which it could be confused. Still,
one must not forget the possibility of a chance
resemblance. Nature doesn’t take out letters-patent even for
a human face. But I will ask you, Gray, to write down
and send to me all that you know about the late Mr.
Bendelow, including all the details of your attendance
on him, dead and alive.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said I, “though it is difficult to imagine what
connexion he could have had with the D’Arblay case.”</p>

<p>“It seems incredible that he could have had any,”
Thorndyke agreed. “But at present we are collecting
facts, and we must note everything impartially. It is
a fatal mistake to select your facts in accordance with
the apparent probabilities. By the way, if Bendelow was
like this photograph he must have corresponded pretty
exactly with Miss D’Arblay’s very complete and lucid
description. I wonder why you did not realize that at
the time.”</p>

<p>“That is what I have been wondering. But I suppose
it was the beard and the absence of any kind of association
between Bendelow and the D’Arblays.”</p>

<p>“Probably,” he agreed. “A beard and moustache alters
very greatly even a striking face like this. Incidentally,
it illustrates the superiority of a picture over a verbal
description for purposes of identification. No mere
description will enable you to visualize correctly a face
which you have never seen. I shall be curious to hear
what Miss D’Arblay has to say about this photograph.”</p>

<p>“I will let you know without delay,” said I; and then,
as he seemed to have completed his work, and put the
documents aside, I made a final effort to extract some
definite information from him.</p>

<p>“It is evident,” I said, “that the body of facts in your
notes has conveyed a good deal more to you than it has
to me.”</p>

<p>“Probably,” he agreed. “If it had not, I should seem
to have profited little by years of professional practice.”</p>

<p>“Then,” I said persuasively, “may I ask if you have
formed a really satisfactory theory as to who this man
is and why he murdered D’Arblay?”</p>

<p>Thorndyke reflected for a few moments and then
replied:</p>

<p>“My position, Gray, is this: I have arrived at a very
definite theory as to the motive of the murder, and a
most extraordinary motive it is. But there are one or
two points that I do not understand. There are some
links missing from the chain of evidence. So with the
identity of the man. We know pretty certainly that he is
the murderer of Van Zellen, and we know what he is
like to look at, but we can’t give him a name and a
definite personality. There are links missing there, too.
But I have great hopes of finding those missing links.
If I find them I shall have a complete case against this
man, and I shall forthwith set the law in motion. I
can’t tell you more than that at present, but I repeat
that you are in possession of all the facts, and that if you
think over all that has happened and ask yourself what it
can mean, though you will not arrive at a complete
solution any more than I have, you will at least begin to see
the light.”</p>

<p>This was all that I could get out of him, and as it
was now growing late I presently rose to take my
departure. He walked with me as far as the Middle Temple
Gate and stood outside the wicket watching me as I
strode away westward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV. <br/> The Haunted Man</h2>

<p>When I arrived at the studio on the following
afternoon I found the door open and Polton waiting just
inside with his hat and overcoat on and his bag in his
hand.</p>

<p>“I am glad you are punctual, Sir,” he said, with his
benevolent smile. “I wanted to get back to the
chambers in good time to-day. It won’t matter to-morrow,
which is fortunate, as you may be late.”</p>

<p>“Why may I be late to-morrow?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I have a message for you from the doctor,” he
replied. “It is about what you were discussing last night.
He told me to tell you that he is expecting a visit from
an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department, and
he would like you to be present, if it would be convenient.
About half-past ten, Sir.”</p>

<p>“I will certainly be there,” said I.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Sir,” said he. “And the doctor told me
to warn you, in case you should arrive after the officer,
not to make any comment on anything that may be said,
or to seem to know anything about the subject of the
interview.”</p>

<p>“This is very mysterious, Polton,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Why, not particularly, Sir,” he replied. “You see
the officer is coming to give certain information, but he
will try to get some for himself if he can. But he won’t
get anything out of the doctor; and the only way for you
to prevent his pumping you is to say nothing and appear
to know nothing.”</p>

<p>I laughed at his ingenuous wiliness. “Why,” I
exclaimed, “you are as bad as the doctor, Polton. A
regular Machiavelli.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of him,” said Polton, “but most
Scotsmen are pretty close. Oh, and there is another little
matter that I wanted to speak to you about—on my own
account this time. I gathered from the doctor, in
confidence, that some one had been following you about.
Now, Sir, don’t you think it would be very useful to be
able to see behind you without turning your head?”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” I exclaimed. “It would indeed! Capital!
I never thought of it. I will have a supplementary eye
fixed in the back of my head without delay.”</p>

<p>Polton crinkled deprecatingly. “No need for that,
Sir,” said he. “I have invented quite a lot of different
appliances for enabling you to see behind you; reflecting
spectacles and walking sticks with prisms in the handle,
and so on. But for use at night I think this will answer
your purpose best.”</p>

<p>He produced from his pocket an object somewhat like a
watchmaker’s eye-glass, and having fixed it in his eye to
show me how it worked, handed it to me with the request
that I would try it. I did so, and was considerably
surprised at the efficiency of the appliance; for it gave me a
perfectly clear view of the street almost directly behind me.</p>

<p>“I am very much obliged to you, Polton,” I said,
enthusiastically. “This is a most valuable gift, especially
under the present circumstances.”</p>

<p>He was profoundly gratified. “I think you will find
it useful, Sir,” he said. “The doctor uses these things
sometimes, and so do I if the occasion arises. You see,
Sir, if you are being shadowed it is a fatal thing to turn
round and look behind you. You never get a chance of
seeing what the stalker is like, and you put him on his
guard.”</p>

<p>I saw this clearly enough and once more thanked him
for his timely gift. Then, having shaken his hand and
sped him on his way, I entered the lobby and shut the
outer door, at the same time transferring Thorndyke’s
photograph from my letter-case to my jacket pocket.
When I passed through into the studio I found Marion
putting the finishing touches to a plaster case. She
greeted me with a smile as I entered and then plunged
her hand once more into the bowl of rapidly thickening
plaster; whereupon I took the opportunity to lay the
photograph on a side-bench as I walked towards the
table on which she was working.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Marion,” said I.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Stephen,” she responded, adding, “I
cannot shake hands until I have washed,” and held out
her emplastered hands in evidence.</p>

<p>“That will be too late,” said I; and as she looked up
at me inquiringly I stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p>“You are very resourceful,” she remarked with a
smile and a warm blush, as she scooped up another
handful of plaster; and then, as if to cover her slight confusion,
she asked: “What was all that solemn pow-wow about
with Mr. Polton? And why did he wait for you at the
door in that suspicious manner? Had he some secret
message for you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it was intended to be secret,”
I answered; “but it isn’t going to be so far as you are
concerned;” and I repeated to her the substance of
Thorndyke’s message, to which she listened with an eagerness
that rather surprised me, until her further inquiries
explained it.</p>

<p>“This sounds rather encouraging,” she said; “as if
Dr. Thorndyke had been making some progress in his
investigations. I wonder if he has. Do you think he
really knows much more than we do?”</p>

<p>“I am sure he does,” I replied; “but how much more,
I cannot guess. He is extraordinarily close. But I have
a feeling that the end is not so very far off. He seems to
be quite hopeful of laying his hand on this villain.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope you are right, Stephen,” she exclaimed.
“I have been getting so anxious. There has seemed to
be no end to this deadlock. And yet it can’t go on
indefinitely.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Marion?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I mean,” she answered, “that you can’t go on wasting
your time here and letting your career go. Of course,
it is delightful to have you here. I don’t dare to think
what the place will be like without you. But it makes
me wretched to think how much you are sacrificing for
me.”</p>

<p>“I am not really sacrificing anything,” said I. “On the
contrary, I am spending my time most profitably in the
pursuit of knowledge and most happily in a sweet
companionship which I wouldn’t exchange for anything in
the world.”</p>

<p>“It is very nice of you to say that,” she said, “but,
still, I shall be very relieved when the danger is over
and you are free.”</p>

<p>“Free!” I exclaimed, “I don’t want to be free. When
my apprenticeship has run out I am coming on as
journeyman. And now I had better get my blouse on and
start work.”</p>

<p>I went to the further end of the studio, and, taking the
blouse down from its peg, proceeded to exchange it for
my coat. Suddenly I was startled by a sharp cry, and,
turning round, beheld Marion stooping over the
photograph with an expression of the utmost horror.</p>

<p>“Where did this come from?” she demanded, turning
a white, terror-stricken face on me.</p>

<p>“I put it there, Marion,” I answered somewhat
sheepishly, hurrying to her side. “But what is the matter?
Do you know the man?”</p>

<p>“Do I know him?” she repeated. “Of course I do.
It is he—the man who came here that night.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure?” I asked. “Are you certain
that it is not just a chance resemblance?”</p>

<p>She shook her head emphatically. “It is he, Stephen.
I can swear to him. It is no mere resemblance. It is a
likeness, and a perfect one, though it is such a bad
photograph. But where did you get it? And why didn’t
you show it to me when you came in?”</p>

<p>I told her how I came by it and explained Thorndyke’s
instructions.</p>

<p>“Then,” she said, “Dr. Thorndyke knows who the
man is.”</p>

<p>“He says he doesn’t, and he was very close and rather
obscure as to how the photograph came into his
possession.”</p>

<p>“It is very mysterious,” said she, with another
terrified glance at the photograph. Then suddenly she
snatched it up and with averted face held it out to me.
Put it away, Stephen,” she entreated. “I can’t bear
the sight of that horrible face. It brings back afresh all
the terrors of that awful night.”</p>

<p>I hastily returned the photograph to my letter-case, and,
taking her arm, led her back to the work-table. “Now,”
I said, “let us forget it and get on with our work;”
and I proceeded to turn the case over and fix it in the
new position with lumps of clay. For a little while she
watched me in silence, and I could see by her pallor that
she was still suffering from the shock of that unexpected
encounter. But presently she picked up a scraper and
joined me in trimming up the edges of the case, cutting
out the “key-ways” and making ready for the second
half; and by degrees her colour came back and the
interest of the work banished her terrors.</p>

<p>We were, in fact, extremely industrious. We not only
finished the case—it was an arm from the shoulder which
was to be made—cut the pouring-holes, and varnished
the inside with knotting, but we filled one-half with the
melted gelatine which was to form the actual mould in
which the wax would be cast. This brought the day’s
work to an end, for nothing more could be done until the
gelatine had set—a matter of at least twelve hours.</p>

<p>“It is too late to begin anything fresh,” said Marion.
“You had better come and have supper with me and
Arabella.”</p>

<p>I agreed readily enough to this proposal, and when
we had tidied up in readiness for the morning’s work
we set forth at a brisk pace—for it was a cold
evening—towards Highgate, gossiping cheerfully as we went. By
the time we reached Ivy Cottage eight o’clock was
striking, and “the village” was beginning to settle down for
the night. The premature quiet reminded me that the
adjacent town would presently be settling down, too, and
that I should do well to start for home before the streets
had become too deserted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so pleasantly did the time slip away in
the cosy sitting-room with my two companions that it
was close upon half-past ten when I rose to take my
departure. Marion escorted me to the door, and as I
stood in the hall buttoning up my overcoat, she said:</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry if you are detained to-morrow.
We shall be making the wax cast of the bust, and I am
certain Mr. Polton won’t leave the studio until it is
finished, whether you are there or not. He is perfectly
mad on wax-work. He wormed all the secrets of the
trade out of me the very first time we were alone, and
he is extraordinarily quick at learning. But I can’t
imagine what use the knowledge will be to him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he thinks of starting an opposition
establishment,” I suggested, “or he may have an eye to a
partnership. But if he has he will have a competitor, and one
with a prior claim. Good-night, dear child. Save some
of the wax-work for me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She promised to restrain Polton’s enthusiasm as far
as possible, and wishing me “Good night,” held out her
hand, but submitted without demur to being kissed; and
I took my departure in high spirits, more engrossed with
the pleasant leave-taking than with the necessity of
keeping a bright look-out.</p>

<p>I was nearing the bottom of the High-street when the
prevailing quiet recalled me to the grim realities of my
position, and I was on the point of stopping to take a look
round when I bethought me of Polton’s appliance and
also of that cunning artificer’s advice not to put a possible
“stalker” on his guard. I accordingly felt in my pocket,
and having found the appliance carefully fixed it in my
eye without altering my pace. The first result was a
collision with a lamp-post, which served to remind me
of the necessity of keeping both eyes open. The
instrument was, in fact, not very easy to use while walking,
and it took me a minute or two to learn how to manage
it. Presently, however, I found myself able to divide my
attention between the pathway in front and the view
behind, and then it was that I became aware of a man
following me at a distance of about a hundred yards.
Of course, there was nothing remarkable or suspicious in
this, for it was a main thoroughfare and by no means
deserted at this comparatively early hour. Nevertheless,
I kept the man in view, noting that he wore a cloth cap
and a monkey-jacket, that he carried no stick or
umbrella, and that when I slightly slackened my pace he
did not seem to overtake me. As this suggested that he
was accommodating his pace to mine, I decided to put
the matter to the test by giving him an opportunity to
pass me at the next side turning.</p>

<p>At this moment the Roman Catholic Church came
into view and I recalled that at its side a narrow
lane—Dartmouth Park Hill—ran down steeply between high
fences towards Kentish Town. Instantly I decided to
turn into the lane—which bent sharply to the left behind
the church—walk a few yards down it and then return
slowly. If my follower were a harmless stranger he
would then have passed on down Highgate Hill,
whereas if he were stalking me I should meet him at the
entrance to the lane and could then see what he was like.</p>

<p>But I was not very well satisfied with this plan, for the
obvious manœuvre would show him that he was
suspected; and as I approached the church, a better plan
suggested itself. On one side by the entrance to the
lane were some low railings and a gate with large brick
piers. In a moment I had vaulted over the railings and
taken up a position behind one of the piers, where I stood
motionless, listening intently. Very soon I caught the
sound of distinctly rapid footsteps, which suddenly grew
louder as my follower came opposite the entrance to the
lane, and louder still as, without a moment’s hesitation,
he turned into it.</p>

<p>From my hiding-place in the deep shadow of the pier
I could safely peep out into the wide space at the entrance
of the lane; and as this space was well lighted by a lamp
I was able to get an excellent view of my follower. And
very much puzzled I was therewith. Naturally I had
expected to recognize the man whose photograph I had
in my pocket. But this was quite a different type of
man. It is true that he was shortish and rather slightly
built, and that he had a beard: but there the resemblance
ended. His face, which I could see plainly by the
lamp-light, so far from being of an aquiline or vulturine cast,
was rather of the blunt and bibulous type. The short,
though rather bulbous nose, made up in colour what it
lacked in size, and its florid tint extended into the cheek
on either side in the form of what dermatologists call
<i lang="la">acne rosacea</i>.</p>

<p>I say that his appearance puzzled me; but it was not
his appearance alone. For the latter showed that he
was a stranger to me and suggested that he was going
down the lane on his lawful occasions; but his movements
did not support that suggestion. He had turned into the
lane and passed my hiding-place at a very quick walk.
But just as he reached the sharp turn he slackened his
pace, stepping lightly, and then stopped for a moment,
listening intently and peering forward into the darkness of
the lane. At length he started again and disappeared
round the corner, and by the sound of his retreating
footsteps I could tell that he was once more putting on the
pace.</p>

<p>I listened until these sounds had nearly died away and
was just about to emerge from my shelter when I became
aware of footsteps approaching from the opposite
direction, and as I did not choose to be seen in the act of
climbing the railings I decided to remain perdu until this
person had passed. These footsteps, too, had a distinctly
hurried sound, a fact which I noted with some surprise;
but I was a good deal more surprised when the
newcomer turned sharply into the entrance, walked swiftly
past my ambush, and then, as he approached the corner,
suddenly slowed down, advancing cautiously on tip-toe,
and finally halted to listen and stare into the obscurity
of the lane.</p>

<p>I peered out at this new arrival with an amazement
that I cannot describe. Like the first man, he was a
complete stranger to me: a tallish, athletic-looking man
of about thirty-five, not ill-looking, and having
something of a military air; fair-complexioned, with a sandy
moustache, but otherwise clean-shaved and dressed in a
suit of thick tweed, with no overcoat. I could see these
details clearly by the light of the lamp; and even as I
was noting them, he disappeared round the corner and
I could hear him walking quickly but lightly down the
lane.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone I looked out from my hiding-place
and listened attentively. There was no one in sight,
nor could I hear any one approaching. I accordingly
came forth, and, quickly climbing over the railings, stood
for a few moments irresolute. The obviously reasonable
thing to do was to make off down Highgate Hill as fast
as I could and take the first conveyance that I could get
homeward. But the appearance of that second man had
inflamed me with curiosity. What was he here for?
Was he shadowing me or was he in pursuit of the other
man? Either supposition was incredible, but one of
them must be true. The end of it was that curiosity got
the better of discretion and I, too, started down the lane,
walking as fast as I could and treading as lightly as
circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>The second man was some considerable distance ahead,
for his footsteps came to me but faintly, and I did not
seem to be gaining on him; and I took it that his speed
was a fair measure of that of the man in front. Keeping
thus within hearing of my quarry, I sped on, turning over
the amazing situation in my bewildered mind. The first
man was a mystery to me, though apparently not to
Thorndyke. Who could he be, and why on earth was
he taking this prodigious amount of trouble to get rid
of a harmless person like myself? For there could be
no mistake as to the magnitude of the efforts that he was
making. He must have waited outside the studio;
followed Marion and me to her home, and there kept a
patient vigil of over two hours, waiting for me to come
out. It was a stupendous labour. And what was it all
about? I could not form the most shadowy guess; while
as to the other man, the very thought of him reduced
me to a state of hopeless bewilderment.</p>

<p>As my reflections petered out to this rather nebulous
conclusion, I halted for a moment to listen for the
footsteps ahead. They were still audible, though they sounded
somewhat farther away. But now I caught the sound
of other footsteps, approaching from behind. Some one
else was coming down the lane. Of course, there was
nothing surprising in that circumstance, for, after all,
this was a public thoroughfare, little frequented as it was,
especially after dark. Nevertheless, something in the
character of those footsteps put me on the qui vive. For
this man, too, was walking quickly—very quickly—and
with a certain stealthiness, as if he had rubber-soled
boots, and, like the rest of us, was making as little noise
as possible.</p>

<p>I walked on at my previous rapid pace, keeping my ears
cocked now both fore and aft; and, as I went, my mind
surged with wild speculations. Could it be that I had
yet another follower? The thing was becoming
grotesque. My bewilderment began to mingle with a spice
of grim amusement; but still I listened, not without
anxiety, to those footsteps from behind, which seemed
to be growing rapidly more distinct. Whoever this
newcomer might be, he was no mean walker, for he was
overtaking me apace; and this fact gave a pretty broad
hint as to his size and strength.</p>

<p>I looked back from time to time, but without stopping
or slackening my pace, trying to pierce the deep obscurity
of the narrow, closed-in lane. But it was a dark winter’s
night, and the high fences shut out even the glimmer
from the murky sky. It was not until the approaching
footfalls sounded quite near that I was able, at length,
to make out a smear of deeper darkness on the general
obscurity. Then I drew out my pistol and, withdrawing
the safety catch, put my hand, grasping it, into my
overcoat pocket. Having thus made ready for possible
contingencies, I watched the black shape emerge from the
darkness until it developed into a tall, portly man,
bearing down on me with long, swinging strides, when I
halted and drew back against the fence to let him pass.</p>

<p>But he had no intention of passing. As he came up
to me, he, too, halted, and, looking into my face with
undissembled curiosity, he addressed me in a brusque
though not uncivil tone.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, I must ask you to explain what is going
on.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” he replied. “I saw you, a little time
ago, climb over the railings and hide behind a
gate-post. Then I saw a man come up in a deuce of a hurry
and turn into the lane. I saw him stop and listen for
a moment and then bustle off down the hill. Close on
this fellow’s heels comes another man, also in a devil
of a hurry. <em>He</em> turns into the lane, too, and suddenly
he pulls up and creeps forward on tip-toe like a cat on
hot bricks. <em>He</em> stops and listens, too; and then off he
goes down the lane like a lamplighter. Then out you
come from behind the gate-post, over the railings you
climb, and then <em>you</em> creep up to the corner and listen,
and then off <em>you</em> go down the hill like another
lamplighter. Now, sir, what’s it all about?”</p>

<p>“I assume,” said I, repressing a strong tendency to
giggle, “that you have some authority for making these
inquiries?”</p>

<p>“I have, sir,” he replied. “I am a police officer on
plain-clothes duty. I happened to be at the corner of
Hornsey-lane when I saw you coming down the High-street
walking in a queer sort of way as if you couldn’t
see where you were going. So I drew back into the
shadow and had a look at you. Then I saw you nip
into the lane and climb over the railings, so I waited to
see what was going to happen next. And then those
other two came along. Well, now, I ask you again, sir,
what’s going on? What is it all about?”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” I said a little sheepishly, “I thought the
first man was following me, so I hid just to see what
he was up to.”</p>

<p>“What about the second man?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about him.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about the first man?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except that he certainly was following me.”</p>

<p>“Why should he be following you?”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine. He is a stranger to me, and so is
the other man.”</p>

<p>“Hm,” said the officer, regarding me with a distrustful
eye. “Damn funny affair. I think you had better walk
up to the station with me and give us a few particulars
about yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will with pleasure,” said I. “But I am not
altogether a stranger there. Inspector Follett knows me
quite well. My name is Gray—Dr. Gray.”</p>

<p>The officer did not reply for a few moments. He
seemed to be listening to something. And now my ear
caught the sound of footsteps approaching hurriedly
from down the lane. As they drew near, my friend
peered into the darkness and muttered in an undertone:</p>

<p>“Will that be one of ’em coming back?” He listened
again for a moment or two, and then, resuming his
inquiries, said aloud: “You say Inspector Follett knows
you. Well, perhaps you had better come and see Inspector
Follett.”</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, he again listened intently,
and his mouth opened slightly. I suspect my own did,
too. For the footsteps had ceased. There was now a
dead silence in the lane.</p>

<p>“That chap has stopped to listen,” my new friend
remarked in a low voice. “We had better see what his
game is. Come along, sir;” and with this he strode off
at a pace that taxed my powers to keep up with him.</p>

<p>But at the very moment that he started, the footsteps
became audible again, only now they were obviously
retreating; and straining my ears I caught the faint sound
of other and more distant footfalls, also retreating, so
far as I could judge, and in the same hurried fashion.</p>

<p>For a couple of minutes the officer swung along like
a professional pedestrian, and I struggled on just behind
him, perspiring freely, and wishing that I could shed
my overcoat. Still, despite our efforts, there was no
sign of our gaining on the men ahead. My friend
evidently realized this, for he presently growled over his
shoulder, “This won’t do,” and forthwith broke into a
run.</p>

<p>Instantly this acceleration communicated itself to the
men in front. The rhythm of both sets of footfalls
showed that our fore-runners were literally justifying
that description of them; and as both had necessarily
given up any attempt to move silently, the sounds of
their retreat were borne to us quite distinctly. And
from those sounds the unsatisfactory conclusion emerged
that they were drawing ahead pretty rapidly. My friend,
the officer, was, as I have said, an uncommonly fine
walker. But he was no runner. His figure was against
him. He was fully six feet in height and he had a
“presence.” He could have walked me off my legs; but
when it came to running I found myself ambling behind
him with such ease that I was able to get out my pistol
and, after replacing the safety-catch, stow the weapon in
my hip pocket, out of harm’s way.</p>

<p>However, if my friend was no sprinter he was
certainly a stayer, for he lumbered on doggedly until the
lane entered the new neighbourhood of Dartmouth Park;
and here it was that the next act opened. We had just
passed the end of the first of the streets when I saw a
surprisingly agile policeman dart out from a shady corner
and follow on in our wake in proper Lillie-bridge style.
I immediately put on a spurt and shot past my
companion, and a few moments later sounds of objurgation
arose from behind. I stopped at once and turned back,
just in time to hear an apologetic voice exclaim:</p>

<p>“I’m sure I beg your pardon, Mr. Plonk. I didn’t
reckernize you in the dark.”</p>

<p>“No, of course you wouldn’t,” replied the plain-clothes
officer. “Did you see two men run past here just now?”</p>

<p>“I did,” answered the constable. “One after the other,
and both running as if the devil was after them. I
was half-way up the street, but I popped down to have
a look at them, and when I got to the corner I heard
you coming. So I just kept out of sight and waited
for you.”</p>

<p>“Quite right too,” said Mr. Plonk. “Well, I don’t
see or hear anything of those chaps now.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed the constable, “and you are not likely
to. There’s a regular maze of new streets about here.
You can take it that they’ve got clear away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m afraid they have,” said Plonk. “Well, it
can’t be helped, and there’s nothing much in it. Good
night, constable.”</p>

<p>He moved off briskly, not wishing, apparently, to
discuss the affair, and in a few minutes we came to the
wide cross-roads. Here he halted and looked me over
by the light of a street lamp. Apparently the result was
satisfactory, for he said: “It’s hardly worth while to
take you all the way back to the station at this time of
night. Where do you live?”</p>

<p>I told him Camden-square and offered a card in
corroboration.</p>

<p>“Then you are pretty close home,” said he, inspecting
my card. “Very well, Doctor. I’ll speak to Inspector
Follett about this affair, and if you have any further
trouble of this sort you had better let us know. And
you had better let us have a description of the men in
any case.”</p>

<p>I promised to send him the particulars on the
following day, and we then parted with mutual good wishes, he
making his way towards Holloway-road and I setting my
face homeward by way of the Brecknock-road and
keeping an uncommonly sharp look-out as I went.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV. <br/> Thorndyke Proposes a New Move</h2>

<p>On the following morning, in order to make sure of
arriving before the detective officer, I presented myself
at King’s Bench-walk a good half-hour before I was
due. The door was opened by Thorndyke himself, and
as we shook hands he said: “I am glad you have come
early, Gray. No doubt Polton explained the programme
to you, but I should like to make our position quite clear.
The officer who is coming here presently is
Detective-Superintendent Miller, of the Criminal Investigation
Department. He is quite an old friend, and he is coming
at my request to give me certain information. But, of
course, he is a detective officer, with his own duties to
his department, and an exceedingly shrewd, capable man.
Naturally, if he can pick up any crumbs of information
from us, he will; and I don’t want him to learn more, at
present, than I choose to tell him.”</p>

<p>“Why do you want to keep him in the dark?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because,” he replied, “we are doing quite well, and
I want to get the case complete before I call in the police.
If I were to tell him all I know and all I think, he might
get too busy, and scare our man away before we have
enough evidence to justify an arrest. As soon as the
investigation is finished, and we have such evidence as
will secure a conviction, I shall turn the case over to
him; meanwhile, we keep our own counsel. Your rôle
this morning will be that of listener. Whatever happens,
make no comment. Act as if you knew nothing that is
not of public knowledge.”</p>

<p>I promised to follow his directions to the letter, though
I could not get rid of the feeling that all this secrecy was
somewhat futile. Then I began to tell him of my
experiences of the previous night, to which he listened at first
with grave interest, but with growing amusement as the
story developed. When I came to the final chase and
the pursuing policeman, he leaned back in his chair and
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Why,” he exclaimed, wiping his eyes, “it was a
regular procession! It only wanted a string of sausages and
a harlequin to bring it up to pantomime form.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I admitted with a grin, “it was a ludicrous
affair. But it was a mighty mysterious affair too. You
see, neither of the men was the man I had expected.
There must be more people in this business than we had
supposed. Have you any idea who these men can be?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t much use making vague guesses,” he replied.
“The important point to note is that this incident,
farcical as it turned out, might easily have taken a tragical
turn; and the moral is that for the present you can’t be
too careful in keeping out of harm’s way.”</p>

<p>It was obvious to me that he was evading my question;
that those two sinister strangers were not the mystery
to him that they were to me, and I was about to return
to the charge with a more definitely pointed question when
an elaborate flourish on the little brass knocker of the
inner door announced a visitor.</p>

<p>The tall, military-looking man whom Thorndyke
admitted was evidently the Superintendent, as I gathered
from the mutual greetings. He looked rather hard at
me until Thorndyke introduced me, which he did with
characteristic reticence.</p>

<p>“This is Dr. Gray, Miller; you may remember his
name. It was he who discovered the body of Mr.
D’Arblay.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember,” said the Superintendent, shaking
my hand unemotionally and still looking at me with a
slightly dubious air.</p>

<p>“He is a good deal interested in the case,” Thorndyke
continued, “not only professionally, but as a friend of
the family—since the catastrophe.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the Superintendent, taking a final
inquisitive look at me and obviously wondering why the deuce
I was there. “Well, there is nothing of a very secret
nature in what I have to tell you, and I suppose you can
rely on Dr. Gray to keep his own counsel and ours.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Thorndyke. “He quite
understands that our talk is confidential, even if it is not
secret.”</p>

<p>The officer nodded, and, having been inducted into
an easy chair, by the side of which a decanter, a siphon,
and a box of cigars had been placed, settled himself
comfortably, lit a cigar, mixed himself a modest refresher,
and drew from his pocket a bundle of papers secured
with red tape.</p>

<p>“You asked me, Doctor,” he began, “to get you all
particulars up to date of the Van Zellen case. Well, I
can do that without difficulty as the case—or at least what
is left of it—is in my hands. The circumstances of the
actual crime I think you know already, so I will take up
the story from that point.</p>

<p>“Van Zellen, as you know, was found dead in his
room, poisoned with prussic acid, and a quantity of very
valuable portable property was missing. It was not clear
whether the murderer had let himself in with false keys or
whether Van Zellen had let him in; but the place hadn’t
been broken into. The job had been done with
remarkable skill, so that not a trace of the murderer was left.
Consequently, all that was left for the police to do was to
consider whether they knew of any one whose methods
agreed with those of this murderer.</p>

<p>“Well, they did know of such a person, but they had
nothing against him but suspicion. He had never been
convicted of any serious crime, though he had been in
chokee once or twice for receiving. But there had been a
number of cases of robbery with murder—or rather
murder with robbery, for this man seemed to have committed
the murder as a preliminary precaution—and they were all
of this kind; a solitary crime, very skilfully carried out by
means of poison. There was never any trace of the
criminal; but gradually the suspicions of the police settled
down on a rather mysterious individual of the name of
Bendelow; Simon Bendelow. Consequently, when the
Van Zellen crime came to light, they were inclined to put
it on this man Bendelow, and they began making fresh
inquiries about him. But presently it transpired that some
one had seen a man, on the morning of the crime, coming
away from the neighbourhood of Van Zellen’s house just
about the time when the murder must have been
committed.”</p>

<p>“Was there anything to connect him with the crime?”
Thorndyke asked.</p>

<p>“Well, there was the time—the small hours of the
morning—and the man was carrying a good-sized
hand-bag, which seemed to be pretty heavy and which would
have held the stuff that was missing. But the most
important point was the man’s appearance. He was
described as a smallish man, clean-shaved, with a big
hooked nose and very heavy eyebrows set close down
over his eyes.</p>

<p>“Now this put Bendelow out of it as the principal
suspect, because the description didn’t fit him at all” (here
I caught Thorndyke’s eye for an instant and was warned
afresh, and not unnecessarily, to make no comment);
“but,” continued the Superintendent, “it didn’t put him
out altogether. For the man whom the description did
fit—and it fitted him to a T—was a fellow named
Crile—Jonathan Crile—who was a pal of Bendelow’s and
was known to have worked with him as a confederate
in the receiving business and had been in prison once or
twice. So the police started to make inquiries about
Crile, and before long they were able to run him to
earth. But that didn’t do them much good; for it turned
out that Crile wasn’t in New York at all. He was in
Philadelphia; and it was clearly proved that he had been
there on the day of the murder, on the day before and
the day after. So they seemed to have drawn a blank;
but they were still a bit suspicious of Mr. Crile, who
seems to have been as downy a bird as his friend
Bendelow, and of the other chappie, too. But they hadn’t
a crumb of evidence against either.</p>

<p>“So there the matter stuck. A complete deadlock.
There was nothing to be done; for you can’t arrest a
man on mere suspicion with not a single fact to support
it. But the police kept their eye on both gents, so far
as they could, and presently they got a chance.
Bendelow made a slip—or, at any rate, they said he did. It
was a little trumpery affair, something in the receiving
line, and of no importance at all. Probably, a faked
charge, too. But they thought that if they could get him
arrested they might be able to squeeze something out
of him—the police in America can do things that we
aren’t allowed to. So they tried to pounce on him. But
Mr. Bendelow was a slippery customer, and he got wind
of their intentions just in time. When they got into his
rooms they found that he had left—in a deuce of a
hurry, too, and only a few minutes before they arrived.
They searched the place, but found nothing incriminating,
and they tried to get on Bendelow’s track, but they
didn’t succeed. He had managed to get clear away, and
Crile seemed to have disappeared, too.</p>

<p>“Well, that seemed to be the end of the affair. Both
of these crooks had made off without leaving a trace,
and the police—having no evidence—didn’t worry any
more about them. And so things went on for about a
year, until the Van Zellen case had been given up and
nearly forgotten. Then something happened quite
recently that gave the police a fresh start.</p>

<p>“It appears that there was a fire in the house in which
Bendelow’s rooms were, and a good deal of damage was
done, so that they had to do some rebuilding; and in
the course of the repairs, the builder’s men found, hidden
under the floor-boards, a small parcel containing part of
the Van Zellen swag. There was nothing of real value;
just coins and medals and seal-rings and truck of that
kind. But the things were all identified by means of Van
Zellen’s catalogue, and, of course, the finding of them
in what had been Bendelow’s rooms put the murder pretty
clearly on to him.</p>

<p>“On this, as you can guess, the police and the detective
agencies got busy. They searched high and low for the
missing man, but for a long time they could pick up no
traces of him. At last they discovered that he and Crile
had taken a passage nearly a year ago on a tramp steamer
bound for England. Thereupon they sent a very smart,
experienced detective over to work at the case in
conjunction with our own detective department.</p>

<p>“But we didn’t have much to do with it. The
American—Wilson was his name—had all the particulars, with
the prison photographs and finger-prints of both the
men, and he made most of the inquiries himself.
However, there were two things that we did for him. We
handed over to him the Van Zellen guinea and the
particulars of the D’Arblay murder; and we were able to
inform him that his friend, Bendelow, was dead.”</p>

<p>“How did you find that out?” Thorndyke asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, quite by chance. One of our men happened to
be at Somerset House looking up some details of a will
when in the list of wills he came across the name of
Simon Bendelow, which he had heard from Wilson
himself. He at once got out the will, copied out the address
of the executrix and the names and addresses of the
witnesses, and handed them over to Wilson, who was
mightily taken aback, as you may suppose. However, he wasn’t
taking anything for granted. He set off instantly to look
up the executrix—a Mrs. Morris. But there he got
another disappointment, for the Morrises had gone away
and no one knew where they had gone.”</p>

<p>“I take it,” said Thorndyke, “that probate of the will
had been granted.”</p>

<p>“Yes; everything in that way had been finished up.
Well, on this, Wilson went off in search of the witnesses,
and he had better luck this time. They were two elderly
spinsters who lived together in a house in Turnpike-lane,
Hornsey. They didn’t know much about Bendelow,
for they had only made his acquaintance after he had
taken to his bed. They were introduced to him by his
friend and landlady, Mrs. Morris, who used to take them
up to his room to talk to him and cheer him up a bit.
However, they knew all about his death, for they had
seen him in his coffin and they followed him to the Ilford
Crematorium.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Thorndyke. “So he was cremated.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” chuckled the Superintendent, with a sly look
at Thorndyke. “I thought that would make you prick
up your ears, Doctor. Yes, there were no half measures
for Mr. Bendelow. He had gone literally to ashes. But
it was all right, you know. There couldn’t have been any
hanky panky. These two ladies had not only seen him
in his coffin; they actually had a last look at him through
a little celluloid window in the coffin-lid, just before the
coffin was passed through into the cremation furnace.”</p>

<p>“And there was no doubt as to his identity?”</p>

<p>“None whatever. Wilson showed the old ladies his
photograph, and they recognized him instantly; picked
his photograph out of a dozen others.”</p>

<p>“Where was Bendelow living when they made his
acquaintance?”</p>

<p>“Not far from their house; in Abbey-road, Hornsey.
But the Morrises moved afterwards to Market-street,
Hoxton, and that is where he died and where the will
was signed.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Wilson ascertained the cause of death?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. The old ladies told him that. But he went
to Somerset House and got a copy of the death certificate.
I haven’t got that, as he took it back with him; but the
cause of death was cancer of the pylorus—that’s some
part of the gizzard, I believe, but you’ll know all about
it. At any rate, there was no doubt on the subject, as
the two doctors made a post-mortem before they signed
the death certificate. It was all perfectly plain and
straightforward.</p>

<p>“Well, so much for Mr. Bendelow. When Wilson had
done with him, he turned his attention to Crile. And
then he really did get a proper shake-up. When he was
at Somerset House, looking up Bendelow’s death
certificate, it occurred to him just to run his eye down the
list and make sure that Crile was still in the land of the
living. And there, to his astonishment, he found Crile’s
name. He was dead, too! And not only was he dead:
he, also, had died of cancer—it was the pancreas this time;
another part of the gizzard—and he had died at Hoxton,
too, and he had died just four days before Bendelow.
The thing was ridiculous. It looked like a conspiracy.
But here again everything was plain and above-board.
Wilson got a copy of the certificate and called on the
doctor who had signed it, a man named Usher. Of
course, Dr. Usher remembered all about the case as it
had occurred quite recently. There was not a shadow of
doubt that Crile was dead. Usher had helped to put him
in his coffin and had attended at his funeral; and he,
too, had no difficulty in picking out Crile’s photograph,
and he had no doubt at all as to what Crile died of. So
there it was. Queer as it looked, there was no denying
the plain facts. Those two crooks had slipped through
the fingers of the law, so far as it was possible to see.</p>

<p>“But I must admit that I was not quite satisfied; the
circumstances were so remarkably odd. I told Wilson
so, and I advised him to look further into the matter.
I reminded him of the D’Arblay murder and the finding
of that guinea, but he said that the murder was our
affair, that the men he had come to look for were dead,
and that was all that concerned him. So back he went
to New York, taking with him the death certificates and
the two photographs with the certificates of recognition
on the backs of them. But he left the notes of the case
with me, on the chance that they might be useful to me,
and the two sets of finger-prints, which certainly don’t
seem likely to be of much use under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“You never know,” said Thorndyke, with an
enigmatical smile.</p>

<p>The Superintendent gave him a quick, inquisitive look
and agreed: “No, you don’t, especially when you are
dealing with Dr. John Thorndyke.” He pulled out his
watch, and, staring at it anxiously, exclaimed: “What a
confounded nuisance! I’ve got an appointment at the
Law Courts in five minutes. It is quite a small matter.
Won’t take me more than half an hour. May I come
back when I have finished? I should like to hear what
you think of this extraordinary story.”</p>

<p>“Come back, by all means,” said Thorndyke, “and I
will turn over the facts in my mind while you are gone.
Possibly some suggestion may present itself in the
interval.”</p>

<p>He let the officer out, and when the hurried footsteps
had died away on the stairs he closed the door and turned
to me with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, Gray,” he said, “what do you think of that?
Isn’t it a very pretty puzzle for a medical jurist?”</p>

<p>“It is a hopeless tangle to me,” I replied. “My brain
is in a whirl. You can’t dispute the facts, and yet you
can’t believe them. I don’t know what to make of the
affair.”</p>

<p>“You note the fact that, whoever may be dead, there
is somebody alive—very much alive, and that that
somebody is the murderer of Julius D’Arblay.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I realize that. But obviously he can’t be either
Crile or Bendelow. The question is: Who is he?”</p>

<p>“You note the link between him and the Van Zellen
murder; I mean the electrotype guinea?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is evidently some connexion, but I can’t
imagine what it can be. By the way, you noticed that
the American police had got muddled about the personal
appearance of these two men. The description of that
man who was seen coming away from Van Zellen’s house,
and who was said to be quite unlike Bendelow, actually
fitted him perfectly. They had evidently made a mistake
of some kind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed that. But the description may have
fitted Crile better. We must get into touch with this
man, Usher. I wonder if he will be the Usher who used
to attend at St. Margaret’s.”</p>

<p>“He is; and I am in touch with him already. In fact,
he was telling me about this very patient, Jonathan
Crile.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Can you remember the substance of what
he told you?”</p>

<p>“I think so. It wasn’t very thrilling.” And here I
gave him, as well as I could remember them, the details
with which Usher had entertained me of his attendance
on the late Jonathan Crile, his dealings with the
landlady, Mrs. Pepper, and the incidents of the funeral,
including Usher’s triumphant return in the mourning coach.
It seemed a dull and trivial story, but Thorndyke listened
to it with the keenest interest, and when I had finished
he asked: “He didn’t happen to mention where Crile
lived, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, curiously enough, he did. The address, I
remember, was 52, Field-street, Hoxton.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Thorndyke. “You are a mine of
information, Gray.”</p>

<p>He rose and, taking down from the bookshelves
Phillip’s Atlas of London, opened it and pored over one
of the maps. Then, replacing the Atlas, he got out his
notes of the D’Arblay case and searched for a particular
entry. It was evidently quite a short one, for when he
had found it he gave it but a single glance and closed the
portfolio. Then, returning to the bookshelves, he took
out the Post Office Directory and opened it at the
“streets” section. Here also his search was but a short
one though it appeared to be concerned with two separate
items; for, having examined one, he turned to a different
part of the section to find the other. Finally he closed
the unwieldy volume and, having replaced it on the shelf,
turned and once more looked at me inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Reflecting on what Miller has told us,” he said,
“does anything suggest itself to you? Any sort of
hypothesis as to what the real facts may be?”</p>

<p>“Nothing whatever,” I replied. “The confusion that
was already in my mind is only the worse confounded.
But that is not your case, I take it.”</p>

<p>“Not entirely,” he admitted. “The fact is that I had
already formed a hypothesis as to the motives and
circumstances which lay behind the murder of Julius
D’Arblay, and I find this new matter not inconsistent
with it. But that hypothesis may, nevertheless, turn out
to be quite wrong when we put it to the test of further
investigation.”</p>

<p>“You have some further investigation in view, then.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am going to make a proposal to Superintendent
Miller—and here he comes, before his time; by
which I judge that he, also, is keen on the solution of
this puzzle.”</p>

<p>Thorndyke’s opinion seemed to be justified, for the
Superintendent entered all agog, and opened the subject
at once.</p>

<p>“Well, Doctor, I suppose you have been thinking over
Wilson’s story? How does it strike you? Have you
come to any conclusion?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Thorndyke. “I have come to the conclusion
that I can’t accept that story at its face value as
representing the actual facts.”</p>

<p>Miller laughed with an air of mingled amusement and
vexation. “That is just my position,” said he. “The
story seems incredible, but yet you can’t raise any
objection. The evidence in support of it is absolutely
conclusive at every point. There isn’t a single weak spot
in it—at least, I haven’t found one. Perhaps you have?”
And here he looked at Thorndyke with eager inquiry in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“I won’t say that,” Thorndyke replied. “But I put it
to you, Miller, that the alleged facts that are offered are
too abnormal to be entertained. We cannot accept that
string of coincidences. It must be obvious to you that
there is a fallacy somewhere and that the actual facts are
not what they seem.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I feel that, myself,” rejoined Miller. “But what
are we to do? How are we to find the flaw in the
evidence, if there is one? Can you see where to look for it?
I believe you can.”</p>

<p>“I think there is one point which ought to be verified,”
said Thorndyke. “The identification of Crile doesn’t
strike me as perfectly convincing.”</p>

<p>“How does his case differ from Bendelow’s?” Miller
demanded.</p>

<p>“In two respects,” was the reply. “First, Bendelow
was identified by two persons who had known him well
for some time and who gave a most circumstantial
account of his illness, his death, and the disposal of his
body; and second, Bendelow’s remains have been cremated
and are therefore, presumably, beyond our reach for
purposes of identification.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Miller objected, “Crile isn’t so very accessible,
being some few feet under ground.”</p>

<p>“Still, he is there; and he has been buried only a few
weeks. It would be possible to exhume the body and
settle the question of his identity once for all.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not satisfied with Dr. Usher’s
identification?”</p>

<p>“No. Usher saw him only after a long, wasting
illness, which must have altered his appearance very greatly;
whereas the photograph was taken when Crile was in his
normal health. It couldn’t have been so very like Usher’s
patient.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Miller; “and I remember that Usher
wasn’t so very positive, according to Wilson. But he
agreed that it seemed to be the same man; and all the
other facts seemed to point to the certainty that it was
really Crile. Still, you are not satisfied? It’s a pity
Wilson took the photograph back with him.”</p>

<p>“The photograph is of no consequence,” said
Thorndyke. “You have the finger-prints; properly
authenticated finger-prints, actually taken from the man in the
presence of witnesses. After this short time it will be
possible to get perfectly recognizable finger-prints from
the body, and those finger-prints will settle the identity of
Usher’s patient beyond any possible doubt.”</p>

<p>The Superintendent scratched his chin thoughtfully.
“It’s a bit of a job to get an exhumation order,” said
he. “Before I raise the question with the Commissioner,
I should like to have a rather more definite opinion from
you. Do you seriously doubt that the man in that coffin
is Jonathan Crile?”</p>

<p>“It is my opinion,” replied Thorndyke—“of course, I
may be wrong—but it is my considered opinion that the
Crile who is in that coffin is not the Crile whose
finger-prints are in your possession.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Doctor,” said Miller, rising and picking up
his hat, “that is good enough for me. I won’t ask you
for your reasons because I know you won’t give them.
But I have known you long enough to feel sure that you
wouldn’t give a definite opinion like that unless you had
got something pretty solid to go on. And I don’t think
we shall have any difficulty about the exhumation order
after what you have said.”</p>

<p>With this the Superintendent took his leave, and very
shortly afterwards Thorndyke carried me off to lunch at
his club before dismissing me to take up my duties at
the studio.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI. <br/> A Surprise for the Superintendent</h2>

<p>It appeared that Thorndyke was correct in his estimate
of the Superintendent’s state of mind, for that officer
managed to dispose in a very short space of time of the
formalities necessary for the obtaining of an exhumation
license from the Home Office. It was less than a week
after the interview that I have recorded when I received
a note from Thorndyke asking me to join him and Miller
at King’s Bench-walk on the following morning at the
unholy hour of half-past six. He offered to put me up
for the night at his chambers, but I declined this
hospitality, not wishing to trouble him unnecessarily; and after
a perfunctory breakfast by gaslight, a ride on an early
tram, and a walk through the dim, lamp-lit streets, I
entered the Temple just as the subdued notes of an
invisible clock bell announced a quarter past six. On my
arrival at Thorndyke’s chambers I observed a roomy
hired carriage drawn up at the entry, and, ascending the
stairs, found “the Doctor” and Miller ready to start, each
provided with a good-sized hand-bag.</p>

<p>“This is a queer sort of function,” I remarked as we
took our way down the stairs; “a sort of funeral the
wrong way about.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Thorndyke agreed; “it is what Lewis Carroll
would have called an unfuneral—and very appropriately,
too. I didn’t give you any particulars in my note, but
you understand the object of this expedition?”</p>

<p>“I assume that we are going to resurrect the late
Jonathan Crile,” I replied. “It isn’t very clear to me what
I have to do with the business, as I never knew Mr. Crile,
though I am delighted to have this rather uncommon
experience. But I should have thought that Usher would
be the proper person to accompany you.”</p>

<p>“So the Superintendent thought,” said Thorndyke,
“and quite rightly; so I have arranged to pick up Usher
and take him with us. He will be able to identify the
body as that of his late patient, and you and I will help
the Superintendent to take the finger-prints.”</p>

<p>“I am taking your word for it, Doctor,” said Miller,
“that the finger-prints will be recognizable, and that they
will be the wrong ones.”</p>

<p>“I don’t guarantee that,” Thorndyke replied, “but still,
I shall be surprised if you get the right ones.”</p>

<p>Miller nodded with an air of satisfaction, and nothing
more was said on the subject until we drew up before
Dr. Usher’s surgery. That discreet practitioner was
already waiting at the open door, and at once took his
place in the carriage, watched curiously by observers from
adjacent windows.</p>

<p>“This is a rum go,” he remarked, diffusing a vinous
aroma into the atmosphere of the carriage. “I really did
think I had paid my last visit to Mr. Crile. But there’s
no such thing as certainty in this world.” He chuckled
softly and continued: “A bit different this journey from
the last. No hatbands this time, and no Sunday-school
children. Lord! When I think of those kids piping
round the open grave, and that our dear departed brother
was wanted by the police so badly that they were actually
going to dig him up, it makes me smile, it does, indeed.”</p>

<p>In effect, it made him cackle; and as Miller had not
heard the account of the funeral, it was repeated for his
benefit in great detail. Then the anecdotal ball was set
rolling in a fresh direction by one or two questions from
Thorndyke, with the result that the entire history of
Usher’s attendance on the deceased, including the
misdeeds of Mrs. Pepper, was retailed with such a wealth
of circumstance that the narration lasted until we stopped
at the cemetery gate.</p>

<p>Our arrival was not unexpected, for as we got out of
the carriage, two gentlemen approached the entrance, and
one of them unlocked a gate to admit us. He appeared
to be the official in charge of the cemetery, while the
other, to whom he introduced us, was no less a person
than Dr. Garroll, the Medical Officer of Health.</p>

<p>“The Home Office license,” the latter explained,
“directs that the removal shall be carried out under my
supervision and to my satisfaction; very necessary in a
populous neighbourhood like this.”</p>

<p>“Very necessary,” Thorndyke agreed gravely.</p>

<p>“I have provided a supply of fresh ground lime,
according to the directions,” Dr. Garroll continued; “and
as a further precaution, I have brought with me a large
formalin spray. That, I think, should satisfy all sanitary
requirements.”</p>

<p>“It should certainly be sufficient,” Thorndyke agreed,
“to meet the requirements of the present case. Has the
excavation been commenced yet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied the cemetery official. “It was started
quite early, and has been carried down nearly to the full
depth; but I thought that the coffin had better not be
uncovered until you arrived. I have had a canvas screen
put up round the grave so that the proceedings may be
quite private. We can send the labourers outside before
we unscrew the coffin-lid. You said, Superintendent, that
you were anxious to avoid any kind of publicity; and I
have warned the men to say nothing to any one about
the affair.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” said Miller. “We don’t want this to
get into the papers, in case—well, in any case.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, sir,” agreed the official, who was evidently
bursting with curiosity himself. “Exactly. Here is the
screen. If you will step inside, the excavation can be
proceeded with.”</p>

<p>We passed inside the screen, where we found four men
reposefully contemplating a coil of stout rope, a basket,
attached to another rope, and a couple of spades. The
grave yawned in the middle of the enclosure, flanked on
one side by the mound of newly dug earth and on the
other by a tub of lime and a Winchester quart bottle
fitted with a spray nozzle and a large rubber bellows.</p>

<p>“You can get on with the digging now,” said the
official; whereupon one of the men was let down into the
grave, together with a spade and the basket, and fell
to work briskly. Then Dr. Garroll directed one of the
other men to sprinkle in a little lime; which he did, with
a pleased smile and so little discretion that the man below
was seen to stop digging, and after looking up
indignantly, take off his cap, shake it violently and
ostentatiously dust his shoulders with it.</p>

<p>When about a dozen basketfuls of earth had been
hoisted up, a hollow, woody sound accompanying the
thrusts of the spade announced that the coffin had been
reached. Thereupon more lime was sprinkled in, and
Dr. Garroll, picking up the formalin bottle, sprayed
vigorously into the cavity until a plaintive voice from
below—accompanied by an unnaturally loud sneeze—was heard
to declare that “he’d ’ave brought his umbrella if he’d
knowed he was goin’ to be squirted at.” A few minutes’
more work exposed the coffin and enabled us to read the
confirmatory inscription on the plate. Then the rope
slings were let down and with some difficulty worked
into position by the excavator below; who, when he had
completed his task, climbed to the surface and grasped
one end of a sling in readiness to haul on it.</p>

<p>“It’s a good deal easier letting ’em down than hoisting
‘em up,” Usher remarked, as the final shower of lime
descended and the men began to haul; “but poor old Crile
oughtn’t to take much lifting. There was nothing of him
but skin and bone.”</p>

<p>However this might be, it took the united efforts of
the four men to draw the coffin up to the surface and
slew it round clear of the yawning grave. But at last
this was accomplished, and it was lifted, for convenience
of inspection, on to one of the mounds of newly dug
earth.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the presiding official, “you men had better
go outside and wait down at the end of the path until
you are wanted again:” an order that was received with
evident disfavour and complied with rather sulkily. As
soon as they were gone, our friend produced a couple of
screw-drivers, with which he and Miller proceeded in a
very workmanlike manner to extract the screws, while
Dr. Garroll enveloped them in a cloud of spray, and
Thorndyke, Usher, and I stood apart to keep out of
range. It was not a long process; indeed, it came to an
end sooner than I had expected, for the first intimation
that I received of its completion was a loud exclamation
(consisting of the single word “Snakes!”) in the voice
of Superintendent Miller. I turned quickly and saw that
officer standing with the raised coffin-lid in his hand,
staring into the interior with a look of perfectly
indescribable amazement. Instantly I rushed forward and
looked into the coffin; and then I was no less amazed.
For in place of the mortal remains of the late Jonathan
Crile, was a portly sack oozing sawdust from a hole in
its side, through which coyly peeped a length of thick
lead pipe.</p>

<p>For a sensible time we all stood in breathless silence
gazing down at that incredible sack. Suddenly Miller
looked up eagerly at Thorndyke, whose sphinx-like
countenance showed the faintest shadow of a smile.</p>

<p>“You knew this coffin was empty, Doctor?” said he.</p>

<p>Thorndyke shook his head. “If I had known,” he
replied, “I should have told you.”</p>

<p>“Well, you suspected that it was empty.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Thorndyke admitted, “I don’t deny that.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why you did, and why it never occurred
to me.”</p>

<p>“It did not occur to you, perhaps, because you were
not in possession of certain suggestive facts which are
known to me. Still, if you consider that the circumstances
surrounding the alleged deaths of these two men were so
incredible as to make us both feel certain that there was
some fallacy or deception in regard to the apparent facts,
you will see that this was a very obvious possibility. Two
men were alleged to have died, and one of them was
certainly cremated. It followed that either the other man
had died, as alleged, or that his funeral was a mock
funeral. There was no other alternative. You must
admit that, Miller.”</p>

<p>“I do, I do,” the Superintendent replied ruefully. “It
is always like this. Your explanations are so obvious
when you have given them, and yet no one thinks of them
but yourself. All the same, this isn’t so very obvious,
even now. There are some extraordinary discrepancies
that have yet to be explained. But we can discuss them
on the way back. The question now is, what is to be
done with this coffin?”</p>

<p>“The first thing to be done,” replied Thorndyke, “is
to screw on the lid. Then we can leave the cemetery
authorities to deal with it. But those men must be sworn
to absolute secrecy. That is vitally important, for if
this exhumation should get reported in the Press, we
should probably lose the whole advantage of this
discovery.”</p>

<p>“Yes, by Jove!” the Superintendent agreed, emphatically.
“It would be a disaster. At present, the late Mr.
Crile is at large, perfectly happy and secure and entirely
off his guard. We can just follow him up at our leisure
and take him unawares. But if he got wind of this, he
would be out of reach in a twinkling—that is, if he is
alive, which I suppose⸺” and here the Superintendent
suddenly paused, with knitted brows.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Thorndyke. “The advantage of
surprise is with us, and we must keep it at all costs. You
realize the position,” he added, addressing the cemetery
official and the Medical Officer.</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” the latter replied, a little glumly, I thought,
“and you may rely on us both to do everything that we
can to keep the affair secret.”</p>

<p>With this we all emerged from the screen and walked
back slowly towards the gate; and as we went, I strove
vainly to get my ideas into some kind of order. But
the more I considered the astonishing event which had
just happened the more incomprehensible did it appear.
And yet I saw plainly that it could not really be
incomprehensible since Thorndyke had actually arrived at its
probability in advance. The glaring discrepancies and
inconsistencies which chased one another through my
mind could not be real. They must be susceptible of
reconciliation with the observed facts. But by no effort
was I able to reconcile them.</p>

<p>Nor, evidently, was I alone the subject of these
difficulties and bewilderments. The Superintendent walked
with corrugated brows and an air of profound cogitation,
and even Usher—when he could detach his thoughts from
the juvenile choir at the funeral—was obviously puzzled.
In fact, it was he who opened the discussion as the
carriage moved off.</p>

<p>“This job,” he observed with conviction, “is what the
sporting men would call a fair knock-out. I can’t make
head nor tail of it. You talk of the late Mr. Crile being
at large and perfectly happy. But the late Mr. Crile died
of cancer of the pancreas. I attended him in his illness.
There was no doubt about the cancer, though I wouldn’t
swear to the pancreas. But he died of cancer all right.
I saw him dead; and, what is more, I helped to put him
into that coffin. What do you say to that, Dr.
Thorndyke?”</p>

<p>“What is there to say?” was the elusive reply. “You
are a competent observer, and your facts are beyond
dispute. But inasmuch as Mr. Crile was not in that
coffin when we opened it, the unavoidable inference is
that after you had put him in, somebody else must have
taken him out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is clear enough,” rejoined Usher. “But
what has become of him? The man was dead; that I
am ready to swear to. But where is he?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Miller. “That is what is bothering me.
There has evidently been some hanky-panky. But I can’t
follow it. It isn’t as though we were dealing with a
supposititious body. There was a real dead man. That
isn’t disputed—at least, I take it that it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is not disputed by me,” said Thorndyke.</p>

<p>“Then what the deuce became of him? And why, in
the name of blazes, was he taken out of the coffin? That’s
what I want to know. Can you tell me, Doctor? But
there! What is the good of asking you? Of course
you know all about it! You always do. But it is the
same old story. You have got the ace of trumps up
your sleeve, but you won’t bring it out until it is time
to take the trick. Now isn’t that the position, Doctor?”</p>

<p>Thorndyke’s impassive face softened with a faint,
inscrutable smile.</p>

<p>“We hold a promising hand, Miller,” he replied quietly;
“but if the ace is there, it is you who will have the
satisfaction of playing it. And I hope to see you put it down
quite soon.”</p>

<p>Miller grunted. “Very well,” said he. “I can see that
I am not going to get any more out of you than that;
so I must wait for you to develop your plans.
Meanwhile I am going to ask Dr. Usher for a signed
statement.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is very necessary,” said Thorndyke. “You
two had better go on together and set down Gray and me
in the Kingsland-road, where he and I have some other
business to transact.”</p>

<p>I glanced at him quickly as he made this astonishing
statement—for we had no business there, or anywhere
else that I knew of. But I said nothing. My recent
training had not been in vain.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, near to Dalston Junction, he
stopped the carriage, and, having made our adieux, we
got out. Then Thorndyke strode off down the
Kingsland-road but presently struck off westward through a
bewildering maze of seedy suburban streets and shabby
squares in which I was as completely lost as if I had been
dropped into the midst of the Sahara.</p>

<p>“What is the nature of the business that we are going
to transact?” I ventured to ask as we turned yet another
corner.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” he replied, “I wanted to hear what
conclusions you had reached in view of this discovery at
the cemetery.”</p>

<p>“Well, that won’t take long,” I said, with a grin.
“They can be summed up in half a dozen words: I have
come to the conclusion that I am a fool.”</p>

<p>He laughed good-humouredly. “There is no harm in
thinking that,” he said, “provided you are not right—which
you are not. But did that empty coffin suggest no
new ideas to you?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” I replied, “it scattered the few ideas
that I had. I am in the same condition as Superintendent
Miller: an inextricable muddle.”</p>

<p>“But,” he objected, “you are not in the same position
as the Superintendent. If he knew all that you and I
know, he wouldn’t be in a muddle at all. What is your
difficulty?”</p>

<p>“Primarily the discrepancies about this man Crile.
There seems to be no possible doubt that he died. But
apparently he was never buried; and you and Miller seem
to believe that he is still alive. Further, I don’t see what
business Crile is of ours at all.”</p>

<p>“You will see that presently,” said he, “and meanwhile
you must not confuse Miller’s beliefs with mine.
However,” he added, as we crossed a bridge over a
canal—presumably the Regent’s Canal—“we will adjourn the
discussion for the moment. Do you know what street
that is ahead of us?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered; “I have never been here before, so
far as I know.”</p>

<p>“That is Field-street,” said he.</p>

<p>“The street that the late Mr. Crile lived in?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered; and as we passed on into the
street from the foot of the bridge, he added, pointing to
a house on our left hand: “And that is the residence of
the late Mr. Crile—empty, and to let, as you observe.”</p>

<p>As we walked past I looked curiously at the house, with
its shabby front and its blank, sightless windows, its
desolate condition emphasized by the bills which announced it;
but I made no remark until we came to the bottom of the
street, when I recognized the cross road as the one along
which I used to pass on my way to the Morrises’ house.
I mentioned the fact to Thorndyke, and he replied: “Yes.
That is where we are going now. We are going to take
a look over the premises. That house also is empty, and
I have got a permit from the agent to view it and have
been entrusted with the keys.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes we turned into the familiar little
thoroughfare, and as we took our way past its
multitudinous stalls and barrows I speculated on the object
of this exploration. But it was futile to ask questions,
seeing that I had but to wait a matter of minutes for
the answer to declare itself. Soon we reached the house
and halted for a moment to look through the glazed door
into the empty shop. Then Thorndyke inserted the key
into the side door and pushed it open.</p>

<p>There is always something a little melancholy in the
sight of an empty house which one has known in its
occupied state. Nothing, indeed, could be more cheerless
than the Morris household; yet it was with a certain
feeling of depression that I looked down the long passage
(where Cropper had bumped his head in the dark) and
heard the clang of the closing door. This was a dead
house—a mere empty shell. The feeble life that I had
known in it was no more. So I reflected as I walked
slowly down the passage at Thorndyke’s side, recalling
the ungracious personalities of Mrs. Morris and her
husband and the pathetic figure of poor Mr. Bendelow.</p>

<p>When from the passage we came out into the hall, the
sense of desolation was intensified, for here not only the
bare floor and vacant walls proclaimed the untenanted
state of the house. The big curtain that had closed in
the end of the hall, and to a great extent furnished it,
was gone, leaving the place very naked and chill.
Incidentally, its disappearance revealed a feature of whose
existence I had been unaware.</p>

<p>“Why,” I exclaimed, “they had a second street door.
I never saw that. It was hidden by a curtain. But it
can’t open into Market-street.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t,” replied Thorndyke. “It opens on
Field-street.”</p>

<p>“On Field-street!” I repeated in surprise. “I wonder
why they didn’t let me in that way. It is really the front
of the house.”</p>

<p>“I think,” answered Thorndyke, “that if you open the
door and look out, you will understand why you were
admitted at the back.”</p>

<p>I unbolted the door, and, opening it, stepped out on
the wide threshold and looked up and down the street.
Thorndyke was right. The thoroughfare was
undoubtedly Field-street, down which we had passed only a few
minutes ago, and close by, on the right hand, was the
canal bridge. Strongly impressed with the oddity of
the affair, I turned to re-enter, and as I turned I glanced
up at the number on the door. As my eye lighted on it
I uttered a cry of astonishment. For the number was
fifty-two!</p>

<p>“But this is amazing!” I exclaimed, re-entering the
hall—where Thorndyke stood watching me with quiet
amusement—and shutting the door. “It seems that Usher
and I were actually visiting at the same house.”</p>

<p>“Evidently,” said he.</p>

<p>“But it almost looks as if we were visiting the same
patient!”</p>

<p>“There can be practically no doubt that you were,” he
agreed. “It was on that assumption that I induced Miller
to apply for the exhumation order, and the empty coffin
seems to confirm it completely.”</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck, not only by the incredible thing
that had happened, but by Thorndyke’s uncanny
knowledge of all the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Then,” I said, after a pause, “if Usher and I
were attending the same man, we were both attending
Bendelow.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly what the appearances suggest,” he
agreed.</p>

<p>“It was undoubtedly Bendelow who was cremated,”
said I.</p>

<p>“All the circumstances seem to point to that
conclusion,” he admitted, “unless you can think of any that
point in the opposite direction.”</p>

<p>“I cannot,” I replied. “Everything points in the same
direction. The dead man was seen and identified as
Bendelow by those two ladies, Miss Dewsnep and Miss
Bonington, and they not only saw him here, but they
actually saw him in his coffin just before it was passed
through into the crematorium. And there is no doubt
that they knew Bendelow by sight, for you remember
that they recognized the photograph of him that the
American detective showed them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he admitted, “that is so. But their identification
is a point that requires further investigation. And
it is a vitally important point. I have my own hypothesis
as to what took place, but that hypothesis will have to
be tested; and that test will be what the logicians would
call the Experimentum Crucis. It will settle one way or
the other whether my theory of this case is correct. If
my hypothesis as to their identification is true, there will
be nothing left to investigate. The case will be complete
and ready to turn over to Miller.”</p>

<p>I listened to this statement in complete bewilderment.
Thorndyke’s reference to “the case” conveyed nothing
definite to me. It was all so involved that I had almost
lost count of the subject of our investigation.</p>

<p>“When you speak of ‘the case,’ ” said I, “what case are
you referring to?”</p>

<p>“My dear Gray!” he protested. “Do you not realize
that we are trying to discover who murdered Julius
D’Arblay?”</p>

<p>“I thought you were,” I answered; “but I can’t connect
this new mystery with his death in any way.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said he. “When the case is completed
we will have a general elucidation. Meanwhile there is
something else that I have to show you before we go.
It is through this side door.”</p>

<p>He led me out into a large neglected garden and along
a wide path that was all overgrown with weeds. As we
went, I tried to collect and arrange my confused ideas,
and suddenly a new discrepancy occurred to me. I
proceeded to propound it.</p>

<p>“By the way, you are not forgetting that the two
alleged deaths were some days apart? I saw Bendelow
dead on a Monday. He had died on the preceding
afternoon. But Crile’s funeral had already taken place a day
or two previously.”</p>

<p>“I see no difficulty in that,” Thorndyke replied.
“Crile’s funeral occurred, as I have ascertained, on a
Saturday. You saw Bendelow alive for the last time
on Thursday morning. Usher was sent for, and saw
Crile dead on Thursday evening, he having evidently
died—with or without assistance—soon after you left.
Of course, the date of death given to you was false; and
you mention in your notes of the case that both you and
Cropper were surprised at the condition of the body. The
previous funeral offers no difficulty, seeing that we know
that the coffin was empty. This is what I thought you
might be interested to see.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a flight of stone steps, at the bottom of
which was a wooden gate set in the wall that enclosed
the garden. I looked at the steps—a little vacantly, I
am afraid—and inquired what there was about them that
I was expected to find of interest.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he replied, “you will see better if we open
the gate.”</p>

<p>We descended the steps, and he inserted a key into the
gate, drawing my attention to the fact that the lock had
been oiled at no very distant date and was in quite good
condition. Then he threw the gate open, and we both
stepped out on to the tow-path of the canal. I looked
about me in considerable surprise, for we were within a
few yards of the hut with the derrick and the little wharf
from which I had been flung into the canal.</p>

<p>“I remember this gate,” said I; “in fact, I think I
mentioned it to you in my account of my adventure here.
But I little imagined that it belonged to the Morris’ house.
It would have been a short way in, if I had known. But
I expect it was locked at the time.”</p>

<p>“I expect it was,” Thorndyke agreed, and thereupon
turned and re-entered. We passed once more down the
long passage, and came out into Market-street, when
Thorndyke locked the door and pocketed the key.</p>

<p>“That is an extraordinary arrangement,” I remarked;
“one house having two frontages on separate streets.”</p>

<p>“It is not a very uncommon one,” Thorndyke replied.
“You see how it comes about. A house fronting on one
street has a long back garden extending to another street
which is not yet fully built on. As the new street fills
up, a shop is built at the end of the garden. A small
house may be built in connexion with it and cut off from
the garden, or the shop may be connected with the
original house, as in this instance. But in either case the shop
belongs to the new street and has its own number. What
are you going to do now?”</p>

<p>“I am going straight on to the studio,” I replied.</p>

<p>“You had better come and have an early lunch with
me first,” said he. “There is no occasion to hurry.
Polton is there and you won’t easily get rid of him, for
I understand that Miss D’Arblay is doing the finishing
work on a wax bust.”</p>

<p>“I ought to see that, too,” said I.</p>

<p>He looked at me with a mischievous smile. “I expect
you will have plenty of opportunities in the future,” said
he, “whereas Polton must make hay while the sun shines.
And, by the way, he may have something to tell you. I
have instructed him to make arrangements with those two
ladies, Miss Dewsnep and her friend, to go into the
question of their identification of Bendelow. I want you to
be present at the interview, but I have left him to fix
the date. Possibly he has made the arrangement by now.
You had better ask him.”</p>

<p>At this moment, an eligible omnibus making its
appearance, we both climbed on board and were duly
conveyed to King’s Cross, where we alighted and lunched
at a modest restaurant, thereafter separating to go our
respective ways north and south.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII. <br/> A Chapter of Surprises</h2>

<p>In answer to my knock the studio door was opened by
Polton; and as I met his eyes for a moment I was
conscious of something unusual in his appearance. I had
scanty opportunity to examine him, for he seemed to be
in a hurry, bustling away after a few hasty words of
apology and returning whence he had come. Following
close on his heels, I saw what was the occasion of his
hurry. He was engaged with a brush and a pot of melted
wax in painting a layer of the latter on the insides of
the moulds of a pair of arms, while Marion, seated on a
high stool, was working at a wax bust, which was placed
on a revolving modelling-stand, obliterating the seams
and other irregularities with a steel tool which she heated
from time to time at a small spirit lamp.</p>

<p>When I had made my salutations, I offered my help
to Polton, which he declined—without looking up from
his work—saying that he wanted to carry the job through
by himself. I sympathized with this natural desire, but
it left me without occupation; for the work which Marion
was doing was essentially a one-person job, and in any
case was far beyond the capabilities of either of the
apprentices. For a minute or two I stood idly looking on
at Polton’s proceedings, but, noticing that my presence
seemed to worry him, I presently moved away—again
with a vague impression that there was something
unusual in his appearance—and, drawing up another high
stool beside Marion’s, settled myself to take a lesson in
the delicate and difficult technique of surface finishing.</p>

<p>We were all very silent. My two companions were
engrossed by their respective occupations, and I must
needs refrain from distracting them by untimely
conversation; so I sat, well content to watch the magical tool
stealing caressingly over the wax surface, causing the
disfiguring seams to vanish miraculously into an unbroken
contour. But my own attention was somewhat divided;
for even as I watched the growing perfection of the bust
there would float into my mind now and again an idle
speculation as to the change in Polton’s appearance.
What could it be? It was something that seemed to have
altered, to some extent, his facial expression. It couldn’t
be that he had shaved off his moustache or whiskers, for
he had none to shave. Could he have parted his hair in
a new way? It seemed hardly sufficient to account for
the change; and looking round at him cautiously I could
detect nothing unfamiliar about his hair.</p>

<p>At this point he picked up his wax-pot and carried it
away to the farther end of the studio to exchange it for
another which was heating in a water-bath. I took the
opportunity to lean towards Marion and ask in a whisper:</p>

<p>“Have you noticed anything unusual about Polton?”</p>

<p>She nodded emphatically, and cast a furtive glance over
her shoulder in his direction.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked in the same low tone.</p>

<p>She took another precautionary glance, and then
leaning towards me with an expression of exaggerated
mystery, whispered:</p>

<p>“He has cut his eyelashes off.”</p>

<p>I gazed at her in amazement, and was about to put a
further question, but she held up a warning forefinger
and turned again to her work. However, my curiosity
was now at boiling-point. As soon as Polton returned
to his bench, I slipped off my stool and sauntered over
to it on the pretence of seeing how his wax cast was
progressing.</p>

<p>Marion’s report was perfectly correct. His eyelids
were as bare of lashes as those of a marble bust. And
this was not all. Now that I came to look at him
critically, his eyebrows had a distinctly moth-eaten
appearance. He had been doing something to them, too.</p>

<p>It was an amazing affair. For one moment I was on
the point of demanding an explanation, but good sense
and good manners conquered the inquisitive impulse in
time. Returning to my stool I cast an enquiring glance
at Marion, from whom, however, I got no enlightenment
but such as I could gather from a most alluring dimple
that hovered about the corner of her mouth and that
speedily diverted my thoughts into other channels.</p>

<p>My two companions continued for some time to work
silently, leaving me to my meditations—which concerned
themselves alternately with Polton’s eyelashes and the
dimple aforesaid. Suddenly Marion turned to me and
asked:</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Polton told you that we are all to have a
holiday to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered; “but Dr. Thorndyke mentioned that
Mr. Polton might have something to tell us. Why are
we all to have a holiday?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, sir,” said Polton, standing up and
forgetting all about his eyelashes, “the Doctor instructed me
to make an appointment with those two ladies, Miss
Dewsnep and Miss Bonington, to come to our chambers
on a matter of identification. I have made the
appointment for ten o’clock to-morrow morning; and as the
Doctor wants you to be present at the interview and wants
me to be in attendance, and we can’t leave Miss D’Arblay
here alone, we have arranged to shut up the studio for
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Marion; “and Arabella and I are going to
spend the morning looking at the shops in Regent-street,
and then we are coming to lunch with you and Dr.
Thorndyke. It will be quite a red-letter day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see what these ladies are coming to the
chambers for,” said I.</p>

<p>“You will see, all in good time, sir,” replied Polton;
and, as if to head me off from any further questions, he
added: “I forgot to ask how your little party went off
this morning.”</p>

<p>“It went off with a bang,” I answered. “We got the
coffin up all right, but Mr. Fox wasn’t at home. The
coffin was empty.”</p>

<p>“I rather think that was what the Doctor expected,”
said Polton.</p>

<p>Marion looked at me with eager curiosity. “This
sounds rather thrilling,” she said. “May one ask who
it was that you expected to find in that coffin?”</p>

<p>“My impression is,” I replied, “that the missing tenant
was a person who bore a strong resemblance to that
photograph that I showed you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she exclaimed. “What a pity! I wish
that coffin hadn’t been empty. But, of course, it could
hardly have been occupied, under the circumstances. I
suppose I mustn’t ask for fuller details?”</p>

<p>“I don’t imagine that there is any secrecy about the
affair, so far as you are concerned,” I answered; “but I
would rather that you had the details from Dr.
Thorndyke, or, at least, with his express authority. He is
conducting the investigations, and what I know has been
imparted to me in confidence.”</p>

<p>This view was warmly endorsed by Polton (who had
by now either forgotten his eyelashes or abandoned
concealment as hopeless). The subject was accordingly
dropped, and the two workers resumed their occupations.
When Polton had painted a complete skin of wax over
the interior of both pairs of moulds, I helped him to put
the latter together and fasten them with cords. Then
into each completed mould we poured enough melted wax
to fill it, and after a few seconds poured it out again,
leaving a solid layer to thicken the skin and unite the
two halves of the wax cast. This finished Polton’s job,
and shortly afterwards he took his departure. Nor did
we remain very much longer, for the final stages of the
surface finishing were too subtle to be carried out by
artificial light, and had to be postponed until daylight
was available.</p>

<p>As we walked homewards we discussed the situation
so far as was possible without infringing Thorndyke’s
confidences.</p>

<p>“I am very confused and puzzled about it all,” she
said. “It seems that Dr. Thorndyke is trying to get on
the track of the man who murdered my father. But
whenever I hear any details of his investigations they
always seem to be concerned with somebody else or with
something that has no apparent connexion with the crime.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly my condition,” said I. “He seems
to be busily working at problems that are totally
irrelevant. As far as I can make out, the murderer has never
once come into sight, excepting when he appeared at the
studio that terrible night. The people in whom
Thorndyke has interested himself are mere outsiders—suspicious
characters, no doubt, but not suspected of the
murder. This man, Crile, for instance, whose empty
coffin we dug up, was certainly a shady character. But
he was not the murderer, though he seems to have been
associated with the murderer at one time. Then there is
that fellow Morris, whose mask we found at the studio.
He is another queer customer. But he is certainly not
the murderer, though he was also probably an associate.
Thorndyke has taken an immense interest in him. But
I can’t see why. He doesn’t seem to me to be in the
picture, or, at any rate, not in the foreground of it. Of
the actual murderer we seem to know nothing at all—at
least, that is my position.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Dr. Thorndyke has really got anything
to go on?” she asked.</p>

<p>“My dear Marion,” I exclaimed, “I am confident that
he has the whole case cut and dried and perfectly clear
in his mind. What I was saying referred only to myself.
<em>My</em> ideas are all in confusion, but <em>his</em> are not. He can
see quite clearly who is in the picture and in what part
of it. The blindness is mine. But let us wait and see
what to-morrow brings forth. I have a sort of feeling—in
fact, he hinted—that this interview is the final move.
He may have something to tell you when you arrive.”</p>

<p>“I do hope he may,” she said earnestly; and with this
we dismissed the subject. A few minutes later we parted
at the gate of Ivy Cottage, and I took my way (by the
main thoroughfares) home to my lodgings.</p>

<p>On the following morning I made a point of presenting
myself at Thorndyke’s chambers well in advance of the
appointed time in order that I might have a few words
with him before the two ladies arrived. With the same
purpose, no doubt, Superintendent Miller took a similar
course, the result being that we converged simultaneously
at the entry and ascended the stairs together. The “oak”
was already open, and the inner door was opened by
Thorndyke, who smilingly remarked that he seemed
thereby to have killed two early birds with one stone.</p>

<p>“So you have, Doctor,” assented the Superintendent—“two
early birds who have come betimes to catch the
elusive worm—and I suspect they won’t catch him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be pessimistic, Miller,” said Thorndyke with a
quiet chuckle. “He isn’t such a slippery worm as that.
I suppose you want to know something of the
programme?”</p>

<p>“Naturally, I do, and so, I suppose, does Dr. Gray.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Thorndyke, “I am not going to tell you
much⸺”</p>

<p>“I knew it,” groaned Miller.</p>

<p>“Because it will be better for every one to have an
open mind⸺”</p>

<p>“Well,” interposed Miller, “mine is open enough.
Wide open, and nothing inside.”</p>

<p>“And then,” pursued Thorndyke, “there is the
possibility that we shall not get the result we hoped for, and
in that case the less you expect the less you will be
disappointed.”</p>

<p>“But,” persisted Miller, “in general terms, what are we
here for? I understand that those two ladies, the
witnesses to Bendelow’s will, are coming presently. What
are they coming for? Do you expect to get any
information out of them?”</p>

<p>“I have some hopes,” he replied, “of learning
something from them. In particular, I want to test them in
respect of their identification of Bendelow.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Then you have got a photograph of him?”</p>

<p>Thorndyke shook his head. “No,” he replied. “I have
not been able to get a photograph of him.”</p>

<p>“Then you have an exact description of him?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply. “I have no description of him
at all.”</p>

<p>The Superintendent banged his hat on the table.
“Then what the deuce have you got, sir?” he demanded
distractedly. “You must have something, you know, if
you are going to test these witnesses on the question of
identification. You haven’t got a photograph, you haven’t
got a description, and you can’t have the man himself
because he is at present reposing in a little terra-cotta pot
in the form of bone-ash. Now, what have you got?”</p>

<p>Thorndyke regarded the exasperated Superintendent
with an inscrutable smile and then glanced at Polton,
who had just stolen into the room and was now listening
with an expression of such excessive crinkliness that
I wrote him down an accomplice on the spot.</p>

<p>“You had better ask Polton,” said Thorndyke. “He
is the stage manager on this occasion.”</p>

<p>The Superintendent turned sharply to confront my
fellow apprentice, whose eyes thereupon disappeared into
a labyrinth of crow’s-feet.</p>

<p>“It’s no use asking me, sir,” said he. “I’m only an
accessory before the fact, so to speak. But you’ll know
all about it when the ladies arrive—and I rather think I
hear ’em coming now.”</p>

<p>In corroboration, light footsteps and feminine voices
became audible, apparently ascending our stairs. We
hastily seated ourselves while Polton took his station by
the door and Thorndyke said to me in a low voice:</p>

<p>“Remember, Gray, no comments of any kind. These
witnesses must act without any sort of suggestion from
anybody.”</p>

<p>I gave a quick assent, and at that moment Polton threw
open the door with a flourish and announced majestically:</p>

<p>“Miss Dewsnep, Miss Bonington.”</p>

<p>We all rose, and Thorndyke advanced to receive his
visitors, while Polton placed chairs for them.</p>

<p>“It is exceedingly good of you to take all this trouble
to help us,” said Thorndyke. “I hope it was not in any
way inconvenient to you to come here this morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all,” replied Miss Dewsnep; “only we are
not quite clear as to what it is that you want us to do.”</p>

<p>“We will go into that question presently,” said
Thorndyke. “Meanwhile, may I introduce to you these two
gentlemen, who are interested in our little business—Mr.
Miller and Dr. Gray?”</p>

<p>The two ladies bowed; and Miss Dewsnep remarked:</p>

<p>“We are already acquainted with Dr. Gray. We had
the melancholy pleasure of meeting him at Mrs. Morris’
house on the sad occasion when he came to examine the
mortal remains of poor Mr. Bendelow, who is now with
the angels.”</p>

<p>“And no doubt,” added Miss Bonington, “in extremely
congenial society.”</p>

<p>At this statement of Miss Dewsnep’s the
Superintendent turned and looked at me sharply with an
expression of enlightenment; but he made no remark, and the
latter lady returned to her original inquiry.</p>

<p>“You were going to tell us what it is that you want
us to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Thorndyke. “It is quite a simple matter.
We want you to look at the face of a certain person who
will be shown to you, and to tell us if you recognize and
can give a name to that person.”</p>

<p>“Not an insane person, I hope!” exclaimed Miss
Dewsnep.</p>

<p>“No,” Thorndyke assured her, “not an insane person.”</p>

<p>“Nor a criminal person in custody, I trust,” added
Miss Bonington.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” replied Thorndyke. “In short, let me
assure you that the inspection of this person need not
cause you the slightest embarrassment. It will be a
perfectly simple affair, as you will see. But perhaps we
had better proceed at once. If you two gentlemen will
follow Polton, I will conduct the ladies upstairs myself.”</p>

<p>On this we rose, and Miller and I followed Polton out
on to the landing, where he turned and began to ascend
the stairs at a slow and solemn pace, as if he were
conducting a funeral. The Superintendent walked at my
side and muttered as he went, being evidently in a state
of bewilderment fully equal to my own.</p>

<p>“Now, what the blazes,” he growled, “can the Doctor
be up to now? I never saw such a man for springing
surprises on one. But who the deuce can he have up
there?”</p>

<p>At the top of the second flight we came on to a landing
and, proceeding along it, reached a door which Polton
unlocked and opened.</p>

<p>“You understand, gentlemen,” he said, halting in the
doorway, “that no remarks or comments are to be
made until the witnesses have gone. Those were my
instructions.”</p>

<p>With this he entered the room, closely followed by
Miller, who, as he crossed the threshold, set at naught
Polton’s instructions by exclaiming in a startled voice:
“Snakes!”</p>

<p>I followed quickly, all agog with curiosity, but
whatever I had expected to see—if I had expected
anything—I was totally unprepared for what I did see.</p>

<p>The room was a smallish room, completely bare and
empty of furniture save for four chairs—on two of
which Polton firmly seated us; and in the middle of the
floor, raised on a pair of trestles, was a coffin covered with
a black linen cloth. At this gruesome object Miller and
I gazed in speechless astonishment, but, apart from
Polton’s injunction, there was no opportunity for an
exchange of sentiments; for we had hardly taken our
seats when we heard the sound of ascending footsteps
mingled with Thorndyke’s bland and persuasive accents.
A few moments later the party reached the door; and
as the two ladies came in sight of the coffin, both started
back with a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Miss Dewsnep, “it’s a dead
person! Who is it, sir? Is it any one we know?”</p>

<p>“That is what we want you to tell us,” Thorndyke
replied.</p>

<p>“How mysterious!” exclaimed Miss Bonington, in a
hushed voice. “How dreadful! Some poor creature who
has been found dead, I suppose? I hope it won’t be
very—er—you know what I mean, sir—when the coffin
is opened.”</p>

<p>“There will be no need to open the coffin,” Thorndyke
reassured her. “There is an inspection window in the
coffin-lid through which you can see the face. All you
have to do is to look through the window and tell us
if the face that you see is the face of any one who is
known to you. Are you ready, Polton?”</p>

<p>Polton replied that he was, having taken up his
position at the head of the coffin with an air of profound
gravity, approaching to gloom. The two ladies shuddered
audibly, but their nervousness being now overcome by a
devouring curiosity, they advanced, one on either side of
the coffin, and, taking up a position close to Polton, gazed
eagerly at the covered coffin. There was a solemn pause
as Polton carefully gathered up the two corners of the
linen pall. Then, with a quick movement, he threw it
back. The two witnesses simultaneously stooped and
peered in at the window. Simultaneously their mouths
opened, and they sprang back with a shriek.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Mr. Bendelow!”</p>

<p>“You are quite sure it is Mr. Bendelow?” Thorndyke
asked.</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” replied Miss Dewsnep. “And yet,” she
continued with a mystified look, “it can’t be; for I saw
him passed through the bronze doors into the cremation
furnace. I saw him with my own eyes,” she added,
somewhat unnecessarily. “And what’s more, I saw his
ashes in the casket.”</p>

<p>She gazed with wide-open eyes at Thorndyke, and then
at her friend, and the two women tiptoed forward and
once more stared in at the window with starting eyes and
dropped chins.</p>

<p>“It is Mr. Bendelow,” said Miss Bonington, in an
awe-stricken voice.</p>

<p>“But it can’t be,” Miss Dewsnep protested in
tremulous tones. “You saw him put through those doors
yourself, Susan, and you saw his ashes afterwards.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help that, Sarah,” the other lady retorted.
“This is Mr. Bendelow. You can’t deny that it is.”</p>

<p>“Our eyes must be deceived,” said Miss Dewsnep, the
said eyes being still riveted on the face within the window.
“It can’t be—and yet it is—but yet it is impossible⸺”</p>

<p>She paused suddenly, and raised a distinctly alarmed
face to her friend.</p>

<p>“Susan,” she said, in a low, rather shaky voice, “there
is something here with which we, as Christian women, are
better not concerned. Something against nature. The
dead has been recalled from a burning fiery furnace by
some means which we may not inquire into. It were
better, Susan, that we should now depart from this place.”</p>

<p>This was evidently Susan’s opinion, too, for she
assented with uncommon alacrity and with a distinctly
uncomfortable air; and the pair moved with one accord
towards the door. But Thorndyke gently detained them.</p>

<p>“Do we understand,” he asked, “that, apart from the
apparently impossible circumstances, the body in that
coffin is, in your opinion, the body of the late Simon
Bendelow?”</p>

<p>“You do,” Miss Dewsnep replied in a resentfully
nervous tone and regarding Thorndyke with very evident
alarm. “If it were possible that it could be, I would
swear that those unnatural remains were those of my
poor friend, Mr. Bendelow. As it’s not possible, it
cannot be.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Thorndyke with the most extreme
suavity of manner. “You have done us a great service
by coming here to-day, and a great service to humanity—how
great a service you will learn later. I am afraid it
has been a disagreeable experience to both of you, for
which I am sincerely sorry; but you must let me assure
you that there is nothing unlawful or supernatural in
what you have seen. Later, I hope you will be able to
realize that. And now I trust that you will allow Mr.
Polton to accompany you to the dining-room and offer
you a little refreshment.”</p>

<p>As neither of the ladies raised any objection to this
programme, we all took our leave of them, and they
departed down the stairs, escorted by Polton. When they
had gone, Miller stepped across to the coffin and cast a
curious glance in at the window.</p>

<p>“So that is Mr. Bendelow,” said he. “I don’t think
much of him, and I don’t see how he is going to help us.
But you have given those two old girls a rare shake-up,
and I don’t wonder. Of course, this can’t be a dead body
that you have got in this coffin, but it is a most lifelike
representation of one, and it took in those poor old Judies
properly. What have you got to tell us about this affair,
Doctor? I can see that your scheme, whatever it was,
has come off. They always do. But what about it?
What has this experiment proved?”</p>

<p>“It has turned a mere name into an actual person,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” rejoined Miller. “Very interesting,
too. Now we know exactly what he looked like. But
what about it? And what is the next move?”</p>

<p>“The next move on my part is to lay a sworn information
against him as the murderer of Julius D’Arblay;
which I will do now, if you will administer the oath and
witness my signature.” As he spoke Thorndyke produced
a paper from his pocket and laid it on the coffin.</p>

<p>The Superintendent looked at the paper with a
surprised grin.</p>

<p>“A little late, isn’t it,” he said, “to be swearing an
information? Of course you can if you like; but when
you’ve done it, what then?”</p>

<p>“Then,” replied Thorndyke, “it will be for you to
arrest him and bring him to trial.”</p>

<p>At this reply the Superintendent’s eyes opened until
his face might have been a symbolic mask of astonishment.
Grasping his hair with both hands, he rose slowly
from his chair, staring at Thorndyke as if at some
alarming apparition.</p>

<p>“You’ll be the death of me, Doctor!” he exclaimed.
“You really will. I am not fit for these shocks at my
time of life. What is it you ask me to do? I am to
arrest this man! What man? Here is a wax-work
gentleman in a coffin—at least, I suppose that is what he
is—that might have come straight from Madame
Tussaud’s. Am I to arrest him? And there is a casket full
of ashes somewhere. Am I to arrest those? Or am I
off my head or dreaming?”</p>

<p>Thorndyke smiled at him indulgently. “Now, Miller,”
said he, “don’t pretend to be foolish, because you are not.
The man whom you are to arrest is a live man, and
what is more, he is easily accessible whenever you choose
to lay your hands on him.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where to find him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Thorndyke replied. “I, myself, will conduct
you to his house, which is in Abbey-road, Hornsey, nearly
opposite Miss D’Arblay’s studio.”</p>

<p>I gave a gasp of amazement on hearing this, which
directed the Superintendent’s attention to me.</p>

<p>“Very well, Doctor,” he said, “I will take your
information, but you needn’t swear to it: just sign your
name. I must be off now, but I will look in to-night
about nine, if that will do, to get the necessary
particulars and settle the arrangements with you. Probably
to-morrow afternoon will be a good time to make the arrest.
What do you think?”</p>

<p>“I should think it would be an excellent time,”
Thorndyke replied; “but we can settle definitely to-night.”</p>

<p>With this, the Superintendent, having taken the signed
paper from Thorndyke, shook both our hands and bustled
away with the traces of his late surprise still visible on
his countenance.</p>

<p>The recognition of the tenant of the coffin as Simon
Bendelow had come on me with almost as great a shock
as it had on the two witnesses, but for a different reason.
My late experiences enabled me to guess at once that the
mysterious tenant was a wax-work figure, presumably of
Polton’s creation. But what I found utterly inexplicable
was that such a wax-work should have been produced in
the likeness of a man whom neither Polton nor
Thorndyke had ever seen. The astonishing conversation
between the latter and Miller had, for the moment, driven
this mystery out of my mind; but as soon as the Superintendent
had gone, I stepped over to the coffin and looked
in at the window. And then I was more amazed than
ever. For the face that I saw was not the face that I
had expected to see. There, it is true, was the old
familiar skull-cap, which Bendelow had worn, pulled
down over the temples above the jaw-bandage. But it
was the wrong face (incidentally I now understood what
had become of Polton’s eyelashes. That conscientious
realist had evidently taken no risks.).</p>

<p>“But,” I protested, “this is not Bendelow. This is
Morris.”</p>

<p>Thorndyke nodded. “You have just heard two
competent witnesses declare with complete conviction and
certainty that this is Simon Bendelow; and, as you,
yourself, pointed out, there can be no doubt as to their
knowledge of Bendelow since they recognized the photograph
of him that was shown to them by the American
detective.”</p>

<p>“That is perfectly true,” I admitted. “But it is a
most incomprehensible affair. This is not the man who
was cremated.”</p>

<p>“Evidently not, since he is still alive.”</p>

<p>“But these two women saw Bendelow cremated—at
least they saw him passed through into the crematorium,
which is near enough. And they had seen him in the
coffin a few minutes before I saw him in the coffin, and
they saw him again a few minutes after Cropper and
Morris and I had put him back in the coffin. And the
man whom we put into the coffin was certainly not this
man.”</p>

<p>“Obviously not, since he helped you to put the corpse
in.”</p>

<p>“And again,” I urged; “if the body that we put into
the coffin was not the body that was cremated, what has
become of it? It wasn’t buried, for the other coffin was
empty. Those women must have made some mistake.”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “The solution of the mystery is
staring you in the face,” said he. “It is perfectly obvious,
and I am not going to give you any further hints now.
When we have made the arrest you shall have a full
exposition of the case. But tell me, now; did those two
women ever meet Morris?”</p>

<p>I considered for a few moments and then replied: “I
have no evidence that they ever met him. They certainly
never did in my presence. But even if they had, they
would hardly have recognized him as the person whom
they have identified to-day. He had grown a beard and
moustache, you will remember, and his appearance was
very much altered from what it was when I first saw
him.”</p>

<p>Thorndyke nodded. “It would be,” he agreed. Then,
turning to another subject, he said: “I am afraid it will
be necessary for you to be present at the arrest. I would
much rather that you were not, for he is a dangerous
brute and will probably fight like a wild cat; but you are
the only one of us who really knows him by sight in his
present state.”</p>

<p>“I should like to be in at the death,” I said eagerly.</p>

<p>“That is well enough,” said he, “so long as it is his
death. You must bring your pistol, and don’t be afraid
to use it.”</p>

<p>“And how shall I know when I am wanted?” I asked.</p>

<p>“You had better go to the studio to-morrow morning,”
he replied. “I will send a note by Polton giving you
particulars of the time when we shall call for you. And
now we may as well help Polton to prepare for our other
visitors; and I think, Gray, we will say as little as possible
about this morning’s proceedings or those of to-morrow.
Explanations will come better after the event.”</p>

<p>With this, we went down to the dining-room, where we
found Polton sedately laying the table, having just got
rid of the two ladies. We made a show of assisting him,
and I ventured to inquire:</p>

<p>“Who is doing the cooking to-day, Polton? Or is it
to be a cold lunch?”</p>

<p>He looked at me almost reproachfully as he replied:</p>

<p>“It is to be a hot lunch, and I am doing the cooking,
of course.”</p>

<p>“But,” I protested, “you have been up to your eyes
in other affairs all the morning.”</p>

<p>He regarded me with a patronizing crinkle. “You can
do a good deal,” said he, “with one or two casseroles, a
hay-box, and a four-story cooker on a gas stove. Things
don’t cook any better for your standing and staring at
them.”</p>

<p>Events went to prove the soundness of Polton’s
culinary principles; and the brilliant success of their
application in practice gave a direction to the conversation
which led it comfortably away from other and less
discussable topics.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII. <br/> The Last Act</h2>

<p>Shortly before leaving Thorndyke’s chambers with
Marion and Miss Boler I managed to secure his permission
to confide to them, in general terms, what was to
happen on the morrow; and very relieved I was thereat,
for I had little doubt that questions would be asked which
it would seem ungracious to evade. Events proved that I
was not mistaken; indeed, we were hardly clear of the
precincts of the Temple when Marion opened the
inquisition.</p>

<p>“You said yesterday,” she began, “that Dr. Thorndyke
might have something to tell us to-day, and I hoped that
he might. I even tried to pluck up courage to ask him,
but then I was afraid that it might seem intrusive. He
isn’t the sort of man that you can take liberties with. So
I suppose that whatever it was that happened this
morning is a dead secret?”</p>

<p>“Not entirely,” I replied. “I mustn’t go into details
at present, but I am allowed to give you the most
important item of information. There is going to be an
arrest to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that Dr. Thorndyke has discovered the
man?” Marion demanded incredulously.</p>

<p>“He says that he has, and I take it that he knows.
What is more, he offered to conduct the police to the
house. He has actually given them the address.”</p>

<p>“I would give all that I possess,” exclaimed Miss
Boler, “to be there and see the villain taken.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “you won’t be far away, for the man
lives in Abbey-road, nearly opposite the studio.”</p>

<p>Marion stopped and looked at me aghast. “What a
horrible thing to think of,” she gasped. “Oh, I am glad
I didn’t know! I could never have gone to the studio if
I had. But now we can understand how he managed
to find his way to the place that foggy night, and to escape
so easily.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is not that man,” I interposed, with a
sudden sense of hopeless bewilderment. For I had
forgotten this absolute discrepancy when I was talking to
Thorndyke about the identification.</p>

<p>“Not that man!” she repeated, gazing at me in wild
astonishment. “But that man was my father’s murderer.
I feel certain of it.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” was my rather lame rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Besides,” she persisted; “if he was not the murderer,
who was he, and why should he want to kill me?”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” I agreed, “it seems conclusive. But
apparently it isn’t. At any rate, the man they are going
to arrest is the man whose mask Thorndyke found at
the studio.”</p>

<p>“Then they are going to arrest the wrong man,” said
she, looking at me with a deeply troubled face. I was
uncomfortable, too, for I saw what was in her mind. The
memory of the ruffian who had made that murderous
attack on her still lingered in her mind as a thing of
horror. The thought that he was still at large and might
at any moment reappear, made it impossible for her ever
to work alone in the studio, or even to walk abroad
without protection. She had looked, as I had, to the discovery
of the murderer to rid her of this abiding menace. But
now it seemed that even alter the arrest of the murderer,
this terrible menace would remain.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” she said dejectedly. “When
you showed me that photograph of the man who tried to
kill me, I naturally hoped that Dr. Thorndyke had
discovered who he was. But now it appears that he is at
large and still untraced, yet I am convinced that he is the
man who ought to have been followed.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, my dear,” I said cheerfully. “Let us
see the affair out. You don’t understand it and neither
do I. But Thorndyke does. I have absolute faith in him,
and so, I can see, have the police.”</p>

<p>She assented without much conviction, and then Miss
Boler began to press for further particulars. I
mentioned the probable time of the arrest and the part that I
was required to play in identifying the accused.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that you are asked to be present
when the actual arrest is made, do you?” Marion asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered. “You see I am the only person who
really knows the man by sight.”</p>

<p>“But,” she urged, “you are not a policeman. Suppose
this man should be violent, like that other man; and he
probably will be.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I answered airily, “that will be provided for.
Besides, I am not asked to arrest him; only to point him
out to the police.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” she said, “you would stay in the studio
until they have secured him. Then you could go and
identify him. That would be much safer.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” I agreed. “But it might lead to their
arresting the wrong man and letting the right one slip.
No, Marion, we must make sure of him if we can.
Surely you are at least as anxious as any of us that he
should be caught and made to pay the penalty?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, “if he is really the right
man—which I can hardly believe. But still, punishing him
will not bring poor Daddy back, whereas if anything
were to happen to you, Stephen⸺ Oh! I don’t dare to
think of it!”</p>

<p>“You needn’t think of it, Marion,” I rejoined,
cheerfully. “I shall be all right. And you wouldn’t have
your apprentice hang back when these Bobbies are taking
the affair as a mere every-day job.”</p>

<p>She made no reply beyond another anxious glance;
and I was glad enough to let the subject drop, bearing
in mind Thorndyke’s words with regard to the pistol.
As a diversion, I suggested a visit to the National Gallery,
which we were now approaching, and the suggestion being
adopted, without acclamation, we drifted in and rather
listlessly perambulated the galleries, gazing vacantly at
the exhibits and exchanging tepid comments. It was a
spiritless proceeding, of which I remember very little
but some rather severe observations by Miss Boler
concerning a certain “hussy” (by one, Bronzino) in the great
room. But we soon gave up this hollow pretence, and
went forth to board a yellow ’bus which was bound for
the Archway Tavern; and so home to an early supper.</p>

<p>On the following morning I made my appearance betimes
at Ivy Cottage, but it was later than usual when
Marion and I started to walk in leisurely fashion to the
studio.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why we are going at all,” said she.
“I don’t feel like doing any work.”</p>

<p>“Let us forget the arrest for the moment,” said I.
“There is plenty to do. Those arms of Polton’s have
got to be taken out of the moulds and worked. It will
be much better to keep ourselves occupied.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it will,” she agreed; and then, as we turned
a corner and came in sight of the studio, she exclaimed:
“Why, what on earth is this? There are some painters
at work on the studio! I wonder who sent them. I
haven’t given any orders. There must be some
extraordinary mistake.”</p>

<p>There was not, however. As we came up, one of
the two linen-coated operators advanced, brush in hand,
to meet us, and briefly explained that he and his mate
had been instructed by Superintendent Miller to wash
down the paint-work and keep an eye on the premises
opposite. They were, in fact, “plain-clothes” men on
special duty.</p>

<p>“We have been here since seven o’clock,” our friend
informed us, as we made a pretence of examining the
window-sashes, “and we took over from a man who had
been watching the house all night. My nabs is there
all right. He came home early yesterday evening, and
he hasn’t come out since.”</p>

<p>“Then you know the man by sight?” Marion asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss,” was the reply, “we have a description
of him, and the man who went into the house seemed
to agree with it; and, as far as we know, there isn’t any
other man living there. But I understand that we are
relying on Dr. Gray to establish the identity. Could I
have a look at the inside woodwork?”</p>

<p>Marion unlocked the door and we entered, followed
by the detective, whose interest seemed to be concerned
exclusively with the woodwork of windows; and from
windows in general finally became concentrated on a
small window in the lobby which commanded a view of
the houses opposite. Having examined the sashes of
this, with his eye cocked on one of the houses aforesaid,
he proceeded to operate on it with his brush, which, being
wet and dirty and used with a singular lack of care, soon
covered the glass so completely with a mass of opaque
smears that it was impossible to see through it at all.
Then he cautiously raised the sash about an inch, and,
whipping out a prism binocular from under his apron,
stood back a couple of feet and took a leisurely survey
through the narrow opening of one of the opposite houses.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” said he. “There is a woman visible at the
first-floor window. Just have a look at her, sir. She
can’t see us through this narrow crack.”</p>

<p>He handed me the glass, indicating the house, and I
put the instrument to my eyes. It was a powerful glass,
and seemed to bring the window and the figure of the
woman within a dozen feet of me. But at the moment
she had turned her head away, apparently to speak to
some one inside the room, and all that I could see was
that she seemed to be an elderly woman who wore what
looked like an old-fashioned widow’s cap. Suddenly she
turned and looked out over the half-curtain, giving me
a perfectly clear view of her face, and then I felt myself
lapsing into the old sense of confusion and bewilderment.</p>

<p>I had, of course, expected to recognize Mrs. Morris.
But this was evidently not she, although not such a very
different-looking woman: an elderly, white-haired widow
in a crape cap and spectacles—reading spectacles they
must be, since she was looking over and not through them.
She seemed to be a stranger—and not yet quite a stranger,
for as I looked at her some chord of memory stirred.
But the cup of my confusion was not yet full. As I
stared at her, trying vainly to sound a clearer note on
that chord of memory, a man slowly emerged from the
darkness of the room behind and stood beside her, and
him I recognized instantly as the bottle-nosed person
whom I had watched from my ambush at the top of
Dartmouth-Park-Hill.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the detective, as the man and woman
turned away from the window and vanished, “what do
you make of ’em? Do you recognize ’em?”</p>

<p>“I recognize the man,” I replied, “and I believe I have
seen the woman before, but they aren’t the people I
expected to see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said he. “That’s a bad look-out.
Because I don’t think there is anybody else there.”</p>

<p>“Then,” I said, “we have made a false shot—and yet—well,
I don’t know. I had better think this over and see
if I can make anything of it.”</p>

<p>I turned into the studio, where I found Marion—who
had been listening attentively to this dialogue—in
markedly better spirits.</p>

<p>“It seems a regular muddle,” she remarked
cheerfully. “They have come to arrest the wrong man and
now it appears that he isn’t there.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me for a few minutes, Marion, dear,”
said I. “There is something behind this and I want to
think what it can be. I have seen that woman
somewhere, I feel certain. Now where was it?”</p>

<p>I cudgelled my brains for some time without succeeding
in recovering the recollections connected with her.
I re-visualized the face that I had seen through the glass,
with its deep-set, hollow eyes and strong, sharply-sloping
eyebrows, and tried to connect it with some person whom
I had seen, but in vain. And then in a flash it came to
me. She was the widow whom I had noticed at the
inquest. The identification, indeed, was not very complete,
for the veil that she had worn on that occasion had
considerably obscured her features. But I had no doubt
that I was right, for her present appearance agreed in
all that I could see with that of the woman at the inquest.</p>

<p>The next question was, Who could she be? Her
association with the bottle-nosed man connected her in some
way with what Thorndyke would have called “the case”;
for that man, whoever he was, had certainly been
shadowing me. Then her presence at the inquest had now a
sinister suggestiveness. She would seem to have been
there to watch developments on behalf of others. Could
she be a relative of Mrs. Morris? A certain faint
resemblance seemed to support this idea. As to the man,
I gave him up. Evidently there were several persons
concerned in this crime, but I knew too little about the
circumstances to be able to make even a profitable guess.
Having reached this unsatisfactory conclusion, I turned,
a little irritably, to Marion, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“I can make nothing of it. Let us get on with some
work to pass the time.”</p>

<p>Accordingly we began, in a half-hearted way, upon
Polton’s two moulds. But the presence of the two
detectives was disturbing, especially when, having finished
the exterior, they brought their pails and ladders inside
and took up their station at the lobby window. We
struggled on for a time; but when, about noon, Miss
Boler made her appearance with a basket of provisions
and a couple of bottles of wine, we abandoned the attempt,
and occupied ourselves in tidying up and laying a table.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, Marion,” I said, as we sat down to
lunch (having provided for the needs of the two
“painters,” who lunched in the lobby), “that it would
be best for you and Arabella to go home before any fuss
begins?”</p>

<p>“Whatever Miss Marion thinks,” Arabella interposed
firmly, “I am not going home. I came down expressly
to see this villain captured, and here I stay until he is
safely in custody.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Marion, “am going to stay with
Arabella. You know why, Stephen. I couldn’t bear to go
away and leave you here after what you have told me.
We shall be quite safe in here.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I temporized, seeing plainly that they had
made up their minds, “you must keep the door bolted
until the business is over.”</p>

<p>“As to that,” said Miss Boler, “we shall be guided
by circumstances;” and from this ambiguous position
neither she nor Marion would budge.</p>

<p>Shortly after lunch I received a further shock of
surprise. In answer to a loud single knock, I hurried out
to open the door. A tradesman’s van had drawn up at
the kerb, and two men stood on the threshold, one of
them holding a good-sized parcel. I stared at the latter
in astonishment, for I recognized him instantly as the
second shadower of the Dartmouth Park Hill adventure;
but before I could make any comment both men entered—with
the curt explanation “police business”—and the
last-comer shut the door, when I heard the van drive
off.</p>

<p>“I am Detective-sergeant Porter,” the stranger
explained. “You know what I am here for, of course.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, and, turning to the other man, I
said: “I think I have seen you before. Are you a
police-officer, too?”</p>

<p>My acquaintance grinned. “Retired Detective-sergeant,”
he explained, “name of Barber. At present employed
by Dr. Thorndyke. I think I have seen you before,
Sir,” and he grinned again, somewhat more broadly.</p>

<p>“I should like to know how you were employed when
I saw you last,” said I. But here Sergeant Porter
interposed: “Better leave explanations till later, Sir. You’ve
got a back gate, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said one of the “painters.” “At the bottom of
the garden. It opens on an alley that leads into the next
road—Chilton-road.”</p>

<p>“Can we get into the garden through the studio?” the
Sergeant asked; and on my answering in the affirmative,
he requested permission to inspect the rear premises. I
conducted both men to the back door and let them out
into the garden, where they passed out at the back gate
to reconnoitre the alley. In a minute or two they
returned; and they had hardly re-entered the studio when
another knock at the door announced more visitors.
They turned out to be Thorndyke and Superintendent
Miller: of whom the latter inquired of the senior painter:</p>

<p>“Is everything in going order, Jenks?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir,” was the reply. “The man is there all
right. Dr. Gray saw him; but I should mention, Sir,
that he doesn’t think it’s the right man.”</p>

<p>“The devil he doesn’t!” exclaimed Miller, looking at
me uneasily, and then glancing at Thorndyke.</p>

<p>“That man isn’t Morris,” said I. “He is that
red-nosed man whom I told you about. You remember.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” Thorndyke replied calmly. “Well, I
suppose we shall have to content ourselves with the
red-nosed man;” upon which ex-Sergeant Barber’s
countenance became wreathed in smiles and the Superintendent
looked relieved.</p>

<p>“Are all the arrangements complete, Sergeant?” Miller
inquired, turning to Sergeant Porter.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the latter replied. “Inspector Follett has
got some local men, who know the neighbourhood well,
posted in the rear watching the back garden, and there
are some uniformed men waiting round both the corners
to stop him, in case he slips past us. Everything is ready,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the Superintendent, “we may as well open
the ball at once. I hope it will go off quietly. It ought
to. We have got enough men on the job.”</p>

<p>He nodded to Sergeant Porter, who at once picked up
his parcel and went out into the garden, accompanied
by Barber. Miller, Thorndyke, and I now adjourned to
the lobby window, where, with the two painter-detectives,
we established a look-out. Presently we saw the Sergeant
and Barber advancing separately on the opposite side of
the road, the latter leading and carrying the parcel.
Arrived at the house, he entered the front garden and
knocked a loud single knock. Immediately the mysterious
woman appeared at the ground-floor window—it was a
bay-window—and took a long, inquisitive look at
ex-Sergeant Barber. There ensued a longish pause, during
which Sergeant Porter walked slowly past the house.
Then the door opened a very short distance—being
evidently chained—and the woman appeared in the narrow
opening. Barber offered the parcel, which was much too
large to go through the opening without unchaining the
door, and appeared to be giving explanations. But the
woman evidently denied all knowledge of it, and, having
refused to receive it, tried to shut the door, into the
opening of which Barber had inserted his foot; but he
withdrew it somewhat hastily as a coal-hammer
descended, and before he could recover himself the door
shut with a bang and was immediately bolted.</p>

<p>The ball was opened, as Miller had expressed it, and
the developments followed with a bewildering rapidity
that far outpaced any possible description.</p>

<p>The Sergeant returning, and joining Barber, the two
men were about to force the ground-floor window, when
pistol shots and police whistles from the rear announced
a new field of operations. At once, Miller opened the
studio door and sallied forth, with the two detectives
and Thorndyke; and when I had called out to Marion to
bolt the door, I followed, shutting it after me.
Meanwhile, from the rear of the opposite houses came a
confused noise of police-whistles, barking dogs and women’s
voices, with an occasional report. Following three rapid
pistol-shots there came a brief interval; then, suddenly,
the door of a house farther down the street burst open
and the fugitive rushed out, wild-eyed and terrified, his
white face contrasting most singularly with his vividly-red
nose. Instantly, the two detectives and Miller started
in pursuit, followed by the Sergeant and Barber; but
the man ran like a hare and was speedily drawing ahead
when suddenly a party of constables appeared from a
side turning and blocked the road. The fugitive
zigzagged and made as if he would try to dodge between
them, flinging away his empty pistol and drawing out
another. The detectives and Miller were close on him,
when in an instant he turned, and with extraordinary
agility, avoided them. Then, as the two Sergeants bore
down on him, he fired at them at close range, stopping
them both, though neither actually fell. Again he
outran his pursuers, racing down the road towards us,
yelling like a maniac and firing his pistol wildly at
Thorndyke and me. And suddenly my left leg doubled up and
I fell heavily to the ground nearly opposite the studio
door.</p>

<p>The fall confused me for a moment and as I lay,
half-dazed, I was horrified to see Marion dart out of the
studio. In an instant she was kneeling by my side with
her arm around my neck. “Stephen! Oh, Stephen, darling!”
she sobbed, and gazed into my face with eyes full
of terror and affection, oblivious of everything but my
peril. I besought her to go back, and struggled to get
out my pistol, for the man, still gaining on his pursuers,
was now rapidly approaching. He had flung away his
second pistol and had drawn a large knife; and as he
bore down on us, mad with rage and terror, he gibbered
and grinned like a wild cat.</p>

<p>When he was but a couple of dozen paces away, I saw
Thorndyke raise his pistol and take a careful aim. But
before he had time to fire, a most singular diversion
occurred. From the open door of the studio, Miss Boler
emerged, swinging a massive stool with amazing ease.
The man, whose eyes were fixed on me and Marion, did
not observe her until she was within a few paces of him;
when, gathering all her strength, she hurled the heavy
stool with almost incredible force. It struck him below
the knees, knocking his feet from under him, and he fell
with a sort of dive or half-somersault, falling with the
hand that grasped the knife under him.</p>

<p>He made no attempt to rise, but lay with slightly
twitching limbs but otherwise motionless. Miss Boler stalked
up to him and stood looking down on him with grim
interest until Thorndyke, still holding his pistol, stooped,
and, grasping one arm, gently turned him over. Then
we could see the handle of the knife sticking out from
his chest near the right shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Thorndyke. “Bad luck to the last. It
must have gone through the arch of the aorta. But
perhaps it is just as well.”</p>

<p>He rose, and stepping across to where I sat, supported
by Marion and still nursing my pistol, bent over me with
an anxious face.</p>

<p>“What is it, Gray?” he asked. “Not a fracture, I
hope?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” I replied. “Damaged muscle and
perhaps nerve. It is all numb at present, but it doesn’t
seem to be bleeding much. I think I could hobble if you
would help me up.”</p>

<p>He shook his head and beckoned to a couple of
constables, with whose aid he carried me into the studio and
deposited me on the sofa. Immediately afterwards the
two wounded officers were brought in, and I was
relieved to hear that neither of them was dangerously hurt,
though the Sergeant had a fractured arm and Barber a
flesh wound of the chest and a cracked rib. The ladies
having been politely ejected into the garden, Thorndyke
examined the various injuries and applied temporary
dressings, producing the materials from a very
business-like-looking bag which he had providently brought with
him. While he was thus engaged three constables entered
carrying the corpse, which, with a few words of apology,
they deposited on the floor by the side of the sofa.</p>

<p>I looked down at the ill-omened figure with lively
curiosity, and especially was I impressed and puzzled by
the very singular appearance of the face. Its general
colour was of that waxen pallor characteristic of the
faces of the dead, particularly of those who have died
from hemorrhage. But the nose and the acne patches
remained unchanged. Indeed, their colour seemed
intensified, for their vivid red “stared” from the
surrounding white like the painted patches on a clown’s face.</p>

<p>The mystery was solved when, the surgical business
being concluded, Barber came and seated himself on the
edge of the sofa.</p>

<p>“Masterly make-up, that,” said he, nodding at the
corpse. “Looks queer enough now, but when he was
alive you couldn’t spot it even in daylight.”</p>

<p>“Make-up!” I exclaimed. “I didn’t know you could
make-up off the stage.”</p>

<p>“You can’t wear a celluloid nose off the stage, or a
tie-on beard,” he replied. “But when it is done as well
as this—a touch or two of nose-paste or toupée-paste,
tinted carefully with grease-paint and finished up with
powder—it’s hard to spot. These experts in make-up are
a holy terror to the police.”</p>

<p>“Did you know that he was made-up?” I asked,
looking at Thorndyke.</p>

<p>“I inferred that he was,” the latter replied, “and so
did Sergeant Barber. But now we had better see what
his natural appearance is.”</p>

<p>He stooped over the corpse, and with a small ivory
paper-knife scraped from the end of the nose and the
parts adjacent a layer of coloured plastic material about
the consistency of modelling-wax. Then with vaseline
and cotton-wool he cleaned away the red pigment until
the pallid skin showed unsullied.</p>

<p>“Why, it <em>is</em> Morris after all!” I exclaimed. “It is
perfectly incredible; and you seemed to remove such
a very small quantity of paste, too! I wouldn’t have
believed that it would make such a change.”</p>

<p>“Not after that very instructive demonstration that
Miss D’Arblay gave us with the clay and the plaster
mask?” he asked with a smile.</p>

<p>I smiled sheepishly in return. “I told you I was a
fool, Sir;” and then, as a new idea burst upon me, I
asked: “And that other man—the hook-nosed man?”</p>

<p>“Morris—that is to say, Bendelow,” he replied, “with
a different, more exaggerated, make-up.”</p>

<p>I was pondering with profound relief on this answer
when one of the painter-detectives entered in search of
the Superintendent.</p>

<p>“We got into the house from the back, Sir,” he
reported. “The woman is dead. We found her lying on
the bed in the first-floor front; and we found a tumbler
half-full of water and this by the bedside.”</p>

<p>He exhibited a small, wide-mouthed bottle labelled
“Potassium Cyanide,” which the Superintendent took
from him.</p>

<p>“I will come and look over the house presently,” the
latter said. “Don’t let anybody in, and let me know when
the cabs are here.”</p>

<p>“There are two here now, sir,” the detective announced,
“and they have sent down three wheeled stretchers.”</p>

<p>“One cab will carry our two casualties, and I expect the
doctor will want the other. The bodies can be put on
two of the stretchers, but you had better send the woman
here for Dr. Gray to see.”</p>

<p>The detective saluted and retired, and in a few
minutes a stretcher dismounted from its carriage was borne
in by two constables and placed on the floor beside
Morris’ corpse. But even now, prepared as I was, and
knowing who the new arrival must be, I looked
doubtfully at the pitiful effigy that lay before me so limp and
passive that but an hour since had been a strong,
courageous, resourceful woman. Not until the white wig, the
cap, and the spectacles had been removed, the heavy
eyebrows detached with spirit, and the dark pigment cleaned
away from the eyelids, could I say with certainty that this
was the corpse of Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>“Well, Doctor,” said the Superintendent, when the
wounded and the dead had been borne away and we were
alone in the studio, “you have done your part to a finish,
as usual, but ours is a bit of a failure. I <em>should</em> have
liked to bring that fellow to trial.”</p>

<p>“I sympathize with you,” replied Thorndyke. “The
gallows ought to have had him. But yet I am not sure
that what has happened is not all for the best. The
evidence in both cases—the D’Arblay and the Van Zellen
murders—is entirely circumstantial and extremely
intricate. That is not good evidence for a jury. A
conviction would not have been a certainty either here or
in America, and an acquittal would have been a disaster
that I don’t dare to think of. No, Miller, I think that,
on the whole, I am satisfied, and I think that you ought
to be, too.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought,” Miller conceded, “but it <em>would</em>
have been a triumph to put him in the dock, after he
had been written off as dead and cremated. However,
we must take things as we find them; and now I had
better go and look over that house.”</p>

<p>With a friendly nod to me, he took himself off, and
Thorndyke went off to notify the ladies that the intruders
had departed.</p>

<p>As he returned with them I heard Marion cross-examining
him with regard to my injuries and listened
anxiously for his report.</p>

<p>“So far as I can see, Miss D’Arblay,” he answered,
“the damage is confined to one or two muscles. If so,
there will be no permanent disablement and he should
soon be quite well again. But he will want proper surgical
treatment without delay. I propose to take him straight
to our hospital if he agrees.”</p>

<p>“Miss Boler and I were hoping,” said Marion, “that
we might have the privilege of nursing him at our house.”</p>

<p>“That is very good of you,” said Thorndyke, “and
perhaps you might look after him during his
convalescence. But for the present he needs skilled surgical
treatment. If it should not be necessary for him to stay in
the hospital after the wound has been attended to, it
would be best for him to occupy one of the spare
bedrooms at my chambers, where he can be seen daily by
the surgeon, and I can keep an eye on him. Come,”
he added coaxingly, “let us make a compromise. You
or Miss Boler shall come to the Temple every day for
as long as you please and do what nursing is necessary.
There is a spare room, of which you can take possession;
and as to your work here, Polton will give you any help
that he can. How will that do?”</p>

<p>Marion accepted the offer gratefully (with my
concurrence), but begged to be allowed to accompany me
to the hospital.</p>

<p>“That was what I was going to suggest,” said
Thorndyke. “The cab will hold the four of us, and the sooner
we start the better.”</p>

<p>Our preparations were very soon made. Then the
door was opened, I was assisted out through a lane of
hungry-eyed spectators, held at bay by two constables,
and deposited in the cab; and when the studio had been
locked up, we drove off, leaving the neighbourhood to
settle down to its normal condition.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX. <br/> Thorndyke Disentangles the Threads</h2>

<p>The days of my captivity at No. 5a, King’s Bench-walk
passed with a tranquillity that made me realize the
weight of the incubus that had been lifted. Now, in the
mornings, when Polton ministered to me—until
Arabella arrived and was ungrudgingly installed in
office—I could let my untroubled thoughts stray to Marion,
working alone in the studio with restored security, free for
ever from the hideous menace which had hung over her.
And later, when she, herself, released by her faithful
apprentice, came to take her spell of nursing, what a joy
it was to see her looking so fresh and rosy, so youthful
and buoyant!</p>

<p>Of Thorndyke—the giver of these gifts—I saw little
in the first few days, for he had heavy arrears of work to
make up. However, he paid me brief visits from time
to time, especially in the mornings and at night, when I
was alone, and very delightful those visits were. For he
had now dropped the investigator, and there had come
into his manner something new—something fatherly or
elder-brotherly; and he managed to convey to me that
my presence in his chambers was a source of pleasure to
him: a refinement of hospitality that filled up the cup of
my gratitude to him.</p>

<p>It was on the fifth day, when I was allowed to sit up
in bed—for my injury was no more than a perforating
wound of the outer side of the calf, which had missed
every important structure—that I sat watching Marion
making somewhat premature preparations for tea, and
observed with interest that a third cup had been placed on
the tray.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Marion replied to my inquiry, “ ‘the Doctor’
is coming to tea with us to-day. Mr. Polton gave me
the message when he arrived.” She gave a few further
touches to the tea-set, and continued: “How sweet Dr.
Thorndyke has been to us, Stephen! He treats me as if
I were his daughter, and, however busy he is, he always
walks with me to the Temple gate and puts me into a
cab. I am infinitely grateful to him—almost as grateful
as I am to you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what you have got to be grateful to me
for,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Don’t you?” said she. “Is it nothing to me, do you
suppose, that in the moment of my terrible grief and
desolation, I found a noble, chivalrous friend whom I
trusted instantly? That I have been guarded through all
the dangers that threatened me, and that at last I have
been rescued from them and set free to go my ways in
peace and security? Surely, Stephen, dear, all this is
abundant matter for gratitude. And I owe it all to you.”</p>

<p>“To me!” I exclaimed in astonishment, recalling
secretly what a consummate donkey I had been. “But
there, I suppose it is the way of a woman to imagine
that her particular gander is a swan.”</p>

<p>She smiled a superior smile. “Women,” said she,
“are very intelligent creatures. They are able to
distinguish between swans and ganders, whereas the swans
themselves are apt to be muddle-headed and
self-depreciatory.”</p>

<p>“I agree to the muddle-headed factor,” I rejoined, “and
I won’t be unduly ostentatious as to the ganderism. But
to return to Thorndyke, it is extraordinarily good of him
to allow himself to be burdened with me.”</p>

<p>“With us,” she corrected.</p>

<p>“It is the same thing, sweetheart. Do you know if
he is going to give us a long visit?”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” she replied. “Mr. Polton said that he had
got through his arrears of work and had this afternoon
free.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said I, “perhaps he will give us the elucidation
that he promised me some time ago. I am devoured by
curiosity as to how he unravelled the web of mystification
that the villain, Bendelow, spun round himself.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said she; “and I believe I can hear his
footsteps on the stair.”</p>

<p>A few moments later Thorndyke entered the room,
and having greeted us with quiet geniality, seated himself
in the easy chair by the table and regarded us with a
benevolent smile.</p>

<p>“We were just saying, Sir,” said I, “how very kind
it is of you to allow your chambers to be invaded by a
stray cripple and his—his belongings.”</p>

<p>“I believe you were going to say ‘baggage,’ ” Marion
murmured.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Thorndyke, smiling at the interpolation,
“I may tell you both in confidence that you were talking
nonsense. It is I who am the beneficiary.”</p>

<p>“It is a part of your goodness to say so, Sir,” I said.</p>

<p>“But,” he rejoined, “it is the simple truth. You
enable me to combine the undoubted economic advantages
of bachelordom with the satisfaction of having a family
under my roof; and you even allow me to participate in
a way, as a sort of supercargo, in a certain voyage of
discovery which is to be undertaken by two young
adventurers, in the near future—in the very near future,
as I hope.”</p>

<p>“As I hope, too,” said I, glancing at Marion, who had
become a little more rosy than usual and who now adroitly
diverted the current of the conversation.</p>

<p>“We were also wondering,” said she, “if we might
hope for some enlightenment on things which have
puzzled us so much lately.”</p>

<p>“That,” he replied, “was in my mind when I arranged
to keep this afternoon and evening free. I wanted to give
Stephen—who is my professional offspring, so to speak—a
full exposition of this very intricate and remarkable
case. If you, my dear, will keep my cup charged as
occasion arises, I will begin forthwith. I will address
myself to Stephen, who has all the facts first-hand; and
if, in my exposition, I should seem somewhat callously
to ignore the human aspects of this tragic story—aspects
which have meant so much in irreparable loss and
bereavement to you, poor child—remember that it is an
exposition of evidence, and necessarily passionless and
impersonal.”</p>

<p>“I quite realize that,” said Marion, “and you may
trust me to understand.”</p>

<p>He bowed gravely, and, after a brief pause, began:</p>

<p>“I propose to treat the subject historically, so to speak;
to take you over the ground that I traversed myself,
recounting my observations and inferences in the order in
which they occurred. The inquiry falls naturally into
certain successive stages, corresponding to the emergence
of new facts, of which the first was concerned with the
data elicited at the inquest. Let us begin with them.</p>

<p>“First, as to the crime itself. It was a murder of a
very distinctive type. There was evidence, not only of
premeditation in the bare legal sense, but of careful
preparation and planning. It was a considered act, and not
a crime of impulse or passion. What could be the motive
for such a crime? There appeared to be only two
alternative possibilities; either it was a crime of revenge or a
crime of expediency. The hypothesis of revenge could
not be explored, because there were no data excepting
the evidence of the victim’s daughter, which was to the
effect that deceased had no enemies, actual or potential;
and this evidence was supported by the very deliberate
character of the crime.</p>

<p>“We were therefore thrown back on the hypothesis of
expediency, which was, in fact, the more probable one,
and which became still more probable as the circumstances
were further examined. But having assumed, as a
working hypothesis, that this crime had been committed in
pursuit of a definite purpose which was not revenge,
the next question was: What could that purpose have
been? And that question could be answered only by a
careful consideration of all that was known of the parties
to the crime: the criminal and the victim and their possible
relations to one another.</p>

<p>“As to the former, the circumstances indicated that
he was a person of some education, that he had an
unusual acquaintance with poisons, and such social position
and personal qualities as would enable him to get
possession of them; that he was subtle, ingenious, and
resourceful, but not far-sighted, since he took risks that could
have been avoided. His mentality appeared to be that of
the gambler, whose attention tends to be riveted on the
winning chances, and who makes insufficient provision
for possible failure. He staked everything on the chance
of the needle-puncture being overlooked and the presence
of the poison being undiscovered.</p>

<p>“But the outstanding and most significant quality was
his profound criminality. Premeditated murder is the
most atrocious of crimes, and murder for expediency is
the most atrocious form of murder. This man, then,
was of a profoundly criminal type, and was most
probably a practicing criminal.</p>

<p>“Turning now to the victim, the evidence showed that
he was a man of high moral qualities: honest, industrious,
thrifty, kindly and amiable, and of good reputation—the
exact reverse of the other. Any illicit association
between these two men was, therefore, excluded, and yet
there must have been an association of some kind. Of
what kind could it have been?</p>

<p>“Now, in the case of this man, as in that of the
other, there was one outstanding fact. He was a sculptor.
And not only a sculptor, but an artist in the highest class
of wax-work. And not only this. He was probably the
only artist of this kind practicing in this country. For
wax-work is almost exclusively a French art. So far as
I know, all the wax figures and high-class lay figures
that are made are produced in France. This man,
therefore, appeared to be the unique English practitioner of
this very curious art.</p>

<p>“The fact impressed me profoundly. To realize its
significance we must realize the unique character of the
art. Wax-work is a fine art; but it differs from all
other fine arts in that its main purpose is one that is
expressly rejected by all those other arts. An ordinary
work of sculpture, no matter how realistic, is frankly an
object of metal, stone, or pottery. Its realism is
restricted to truth of form. No deception is aimed at but,
on the contrary, is expressly avoided. But the aim of
wax-work is complete deception; and its perfection is
measured by the completeness of the deception achieved.
How complete that may be can be judged by incidents
that have occurred at Madame Tussaud’s. When that
exhibition was at the old Baker-street Bazaar, the
snuff-taker—whose arms, head, and eyes were moved by
clock-work—used to be seated on an open bench; and it is
recorded that, quite frequently, visitors would sit down
by him on the bench and try to open conversation with
him. So, too, the wax-work policeman near the outer
door was occasionally accosted with questions by arriving
visitors.</p>

<p>“Bearing this fact in mind, it is obvious that this art
is peculiarly adapted to employment in certain kinds of
fraud, such as personation, false alibi, and the like; and
it is probable that the only reason why it is not so
employed is the great difficulty of obtaining first-class
wax-works.</p>

<p>“Naturally, then, when I observed this connexion of a
criminal with a wax-work artist, I asked myself whether
the motive of the murder was not to be sought in that
artist’s unique powers. Could it be that an attempt had
been made to employ the deceased on some work designed
for a fraudulent purpose? If such an attempt had been
made, whether it had or had not been successful, the
deceased would be in possession of knowledge which
would be highly dangerous to the criminal; but especially
if a work had actually been executed and used as an
instrument of fraud.</p>

<p>“But there were other possibilities in the case of a
sculptor who was also a medallist. He might have been
employed to produce—quite innocently—copies of
valuable works which were intended for fraudulent use; and
the second stage of the investigation was concerned with
these possibilities. That stage was ushered in by Follett’s
discovery of the guinea; the additional facts that we
obtained at the Museum, and later, when we learned that
the guinea that had been found was an electrotype copy,
and that deceased was an expert electrotyper, all seemed
to point to the production of forgeries as the crime in
which Julius D’Arblay had been implicated. That was
the view to which we seemed to be committed; but it did
not seem to me satisfactory, for several reasons. First,
the motive was insufficient—there was really nothing to
conceal. When the forgeries were offered for sale, it
would be obvious that some one had made them, and that
some one could be traced by the purchaser through the
vendor. The killing of the actual maker would give no
security to the man who sold the forgeries, and who would
have to appear in the transaction. And then, although
deceased was unique as a wax-worker, he was not as a
copyist or electrotyper. For those purposes, much more
suitable accomplices might have been found. The
execution of copies by deceased appeared to be a fact; but my
own feeling was that they had been a mere by-product—that
they had been used as a means of introduction to
deceased for some other purpose connected with
wax-work.</p>

<p>“At the end of this stage we had made some progress.
We had identified this unknown man with another
unknown man, who was undoubtedly a professional
criminal. We had found, in the forged guinea, a possible
motive for the murder. But, as I have said, that
explanation did not satisfy me, and I still kept a look-out
for new evidence connected with the wax-works.</p>

<p>“The next stage opened on that night when you arrived
at Cornishes’, looking like a resuscitated ‘found drowned.’
Your account of your fall into the canal and the
immediately antecedent events made a deep impression on me,
though I did not, at the time, connect them with the
crime that we were investigating. But the whole affair
was so abnormal that it seemed to call for very careful
consideration; and the more I considered it the more
abnormal did it appear.</p>

<p>“The theory of an accident could not be entertained,
nor could the dropping of that derrick have been a
practical joke. Your objection that no one was in sight had
no weight, since there was a gate in the wall by which
a person could have made his escape. Some one had
attempted to murder you: and that attempt had been
made immediately after you had signed a cremation
certificate. That was a very impressive fact. As you
know, it is my habit to look very narrowly at cremation
cases, for the reason that cremation offers great facilities
for certain kinds of crime. Poisoners—and particularly
arsenic and antimony poisoners—have repeatedly been
convicted on evidence furnished by an exhumed body.
If such poisoners can get the corpse of the victim
cremated, they are virtually safe; for whatever suspicions
may thereafter arise, no conviction is possible, since the
means of proving the administration have been destroyed.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, I considered very carefully your account
of the proceedings, and as I did so strong suggestions of
fraud arose in all directions. There was, for instance,
the inspection window in the coffin. What was its
object? Inspection windows are usually provided only in
cases where the condition of the body is such that it
has to be enclosed in a hermetically sealed coffin. But
no such condition existed in this case. There was no
reason why the friends should not have viewed the body
in the usual manner in an open coffin. Again, there was
the curious alternation of you and the two witnesses.
First they went up and viewed deceased—through the
window. Then, after a considerable interval, you and
Cropper went up and viewed deceased through the
window. Then you took out the body, examined it, and
put it back. Again, after a considerable interval, the
witnesses went up a second time and viewed the
deceased—through the window.</p>

<p>“It was all rather queer and suspicious, especially when
considered in conjunction with the attempt on your life.
Reflecting on the latter, the question of the gate in the
wall by the canal arose in my mind, and I examined the
map to see if I could locate it. It was not marked, but
the wharf was, and from this and your description it
appeared certain that the gate must be in the wall of the
garden of Morris’ house. Here was another suspicious
fact. For Morris—who could have let you out by this
side gate—sent you by a long, round-about route to the
tow-path. He knew which way you must be
going—westward—and could have slipped out of the gate and
waited for you in the hut by the wharf. It was possible,
and there seemed to be no other explanation of what had
happened to you. Incidentally, I made another discovery.
This map showed that Morris’ house had two frontages,
one on Field-street and one on Market-street, and that
you appeared to have been admitted by the back entrance.
Which was another slightly abnormal circumstance.</p>

<p>“I was very much puzzled by the affair. There was a
distinct suggestion that some fraud—some deception—had
been practiced; that what the spinsters saw through
the coffin window was not the same thing as that which
you saw. And yet, what could the deception have been?
There was no question about the body. It was a real
body. The disease was undoubtedly genuine, and was,
at least, the effective cause of death. And the
cremation was necessarily genuine; for though you can bury
an empty coffin, you can’t cremate one. The absence of
calcined bone would expose the fraud instantly.</p>

<p>“I considered the possibility of a second body; that of
a murdered person, for instance. But that would not do.
For if a substitution had been effected, there would still
have been a redundant body to dispose of and account
for. Nothing would have been gained by the
substitution.</p>

<p>“But there was another possibility to which no such
objection applied. Assuming a fraud to have been
perpetrated, here was a case adapted in the most perfect
manner to the use of a wax-work. Of course, a
full-length figure would have been impossible, because it
would have left no calcined bones. But the inspection
window would have made it unnecessary. A wax head
would have done; or, better still, a wax mask, which
could have been simply placed over the face of the real
corpse. The more I thought about it the more was I
impressed by the singular suitability of the arrangements
to the use of a wax mask. The inspection window seemed
to be designed for the very purpose—to restrict the view
to a mere face and to prevent the mask from being
touched and the fraud thus discovered—and the alternate
inspections by you and the spinsters were quite in
keeping with a deception of that kind.</p>

<p>“There was another very queer feature in the case.
These people, living at Hoxton, elected to employ a
doctor who lived miles away at Bloomsbury. Why did they
not call in a neighbouring practitioner? Also, they
arranged the days and even the hours at which the visits
were to be made. Why? There was an evident
suggestion of something that the doctor was not to
know—something or somebody that he was not desired to see; that
some preparations had to be made for his visits.</p>

<p>“Again, the note was addressed to Dr. Stephen Gray,
not to Dr. Cornish. They knew your name and address,
although you had only just come there, and they did not
know Dr. Cornish, who was an old resident. How was
this? The only explanation seemed to be that they had
read the report of the inquest, or even been present at
it. You there stated publicly that your temporary
address was at 61, Mecklenburgh-square; that you were,
in fact, a bird of passage; and you gave your full name
and your age. Now if any fraud was being carried out,
a bird of passage, who might be difficult to find later, and
a young one at that, was just the most suitable kind of
doctor.</p>

<p>“To sum up the evidence at this stage: The
circumstances, taken as a whole, suggested in the strongest
possible manner that there was something fraudulent about
this cremation. That fraud must be some kind of
substitution or personation with the purpose of obtaining a
certificate that some person had been cremated who had,
in fact, not been cremated. In that case it was nearly
certain that the dead man was not Simon Bendelow; for
the certificates would be required to agree with the false
appearances, not with the true. There was a suggestion—but
only a speculative one—that the deception might have
been effected by means of a wax mask.</p>

<p>“There were, however, two objections. As to the wax
mask, there was the great difficulty of obtaining one. A
perfect portrait mask could have been obtained only either
from an artist in Paris or from Julius D’Arblay. The
objection to the substitution theory was that there was a
real body—the body of a real person. If the cremation
was in a name which was not the name of that person,
then the disappearance of that person would remain
unaccounted for.</p>

<p>“So you see that the whole theory of the fraud was
purely conjectural. There was not a single particle of
direct evidence. You also see that at two points there
was a faint hint of a connexion between this case and
the murder of Mr. D’Arblay. These people seemed to
have read of, or attended at the inquest; and if a wax
mask existed, it was quite probably made by him.</p>

<p>“The next stage opens with the discovery of the mask
at the studio. But there are certain antecedent matters
that must first be glanced at. When the attempt was
made to murder Marion, I asked myself four questions:
‘1. Why did this man want to kill Marion? 2. What did
he come to the studio on the preceding night to search
for? 3. Did he find it, whatever it was? 4. Why did he
delay so long to make the search?’</p>

<p>“Let us begin with the second question. What had
he come to look for? The obvious suggestion was that
he had come to get possession of some incriminating
object. But what was that object? Could it be the mould
of some forged coin or medal? I did not believe that
it was. For since the forgery or forgeries were extant,
the moulds had no particular significance; and what little
significance they had applied to Mr. D’Arblay, who was,
technically, the forger. My feeling was that the object
was in some way connected with wax-work, and in all
probability with a wax portrait mask, as the most likely
thing to be used for a fraudulent purpose. And I need
hardly say that the cremation case lurked in the back of
my mind.</p>

<p>“This view was supported by consideration of the
third question. Did he find what he came to seek? If
he came for moulds of coins or medals, he must have
found them; for none remained. But the fact that he
came the next night and attempted to murder Marion—believing
her to be alone—suggested that his search had
failed. And consideration of the fourth question
led—less decisively—to the same conclusion as to the nature
of the object sought.</p>

<p>“Why had he waited all this time to make the search?
Why had he not entered the studio immediately after the
murder, when the place was mostly unoccupied? The
most probable explanation appeared to me to be that he
had only recently become aware that there was any
incriminating object in existence. Proceeding on the
hypothesis that he had commissioned Mr. D’Arblay to make
a wax portrait mask, I further assumed that he knew
little of the process, and—perhaps misunderstanding Mr.
D’Arblay—confused the technique of wax with that of
plaster. In making a plaster mask from life—as you
probably know by this time—you have to destroy the
mould to get the mask out. So when the mask has been
delivered to the client, there is nothing left.</p>

<p>“But to make a wax mask, you must first make one
of plaster to serve as a matrix from which to make the
gelatine mould for the wax. Then, when the wax mask
has been delivered to the client, the plaster matrix
remains in the possession of the artist.</p>

<p>“The suggestion, then, was that this man had supposed
that the mould had been destroyed in making the mask,
and that only some time after the murder had he, in some
way, discovered his mistake. When he did discover it,
he would see what an appalling blunder he had made;
for the plaster matrix was the likeness of his own face.</p>

<p>“You see that all this was highly speculative. It was
all hypothetical, and it might all have been totally
fallacious. We still had not a single solid fact; but all the
hypothetical matter was consistent, and each inference
seemed to support the others.”</p>

<p>“And what,” I asked, “did you suppose was his motive
for trying to make away with Marion?”</p>

<p>“In the first place,” he replied, “I inferred that he
looked on her as a dangerous person who might have some
knowledge of his transactions with her father. This was
probably the explanation of his attempt when he cut
the brake-wire of her bicycle. But the second, more
desperate attack, was made, I assume, when he had
realized the existence of the plaster mask, and supposed that
she knew of it, too. If he had killed her, he would
probably have made another search with the studio fully
lighted up.</p>

<p>“To return to our inquiry. You see that I had a mass
of hypothesis but not a single real fact. But I still had
a firm belief that a wax mask had been made and that—if
it had not been destroyed—there must be a plaster
mask somewhere in the studio. That was what I came
to look for that morning; and as it happens that I am
some six inches taller than Bendelow was, I was able
to see what had been invisible to him. When I
discovered that mask, and when Marion had disclaimed all
knowledge of it, my hopes began to rise. But when you
identified the face as that of Morris, I felt that our
problem was solved. In an instant, my card-house of
speculative hypothesis was changed into a solid edifice. What
had been but bare possibilities had now become so highly
probable that they were almost certainties.</p>

<p>“Let us consider what the finding of this mask
proved—subject, of course, to verification. It proved that a
wax mask of Morris had been made—for here was the
matrix, varnished, as you will remember, in readiness
for the gelatine mould; and that mask was obviously
obtained for the purpose of a fraudulent cremation. And
that mask was made by Julius D’Arblay.</p>

<p>“What was the purpose of the fraud? It was perfectly
obvious. Morris was clearly the real Simon Bendelow,
and the purpose of the fraud was to create undeniable
evidence that he was dead. But why did he want to
prove that he was dead? Well, we knew that he was
the murderer of Van Zellen, for whom the American
police were searching, and he might be in more danger
than we knew. At any rate, a death certificate would
make him absolutely secure—on one condition—that the
body was cremated. Mere burial would not be enough;
for an exhumation would discover the fraud. But
perfect security could be secured only by destruction of all
evidence of the fraud. Julius D’Arblay held such
evidence. Therefore Julius D’Arblay must be got rid of.
Here, then, was an amply sufficient motive for the
murder. The only point which remained obscure was the
identity of your patient, and the means by which his
disappearance had been accounted for.</p>

<p>“My hypothesis, then, had been changed into highly
probable theory. The next stage was the necessary
verification. I began with a rather curious experiment. The
man who tried to murder Marion could have been no
other than her father’s murderer. Then he must have
been Morris. But it seemed that he was totally unlike
Morris, and the mask evidently suggested to her no
resemblance. But yet it was probable that the man was
Morris, for the striking features—the hook nose and the
heavy brows—would be easily ‘made up,’ especially at
night. The question was whether the face was Morris’s
with these additions. I determined to put that question
to the test. And here Polton’s new accomplishment came
to our aid.</p>

<p>“First, with a pinch of clay, we built up on Morris’s
mask a nose of the shape described and slightly thickened
the brows. Then Polton made a gelatine mould, and
from this produced a wax mask. He fitted it with glass
eyes and attached it to a rough plaster head, with ears
which were casts of my own painted. We then fixed on
a moustache, beard, and wig, and put on a shirt, collar,
and jacket. It was an extraordinarily crude affair,
suggestive of the fifth of November. But it answered the
purpose, which was to produce a photograph; for we
made the photograph so bad—so confused and
ill-focussed—that the crudities disappeared, while the essential
likeness remained. As you know, that photograph was
instantly recognized, without any sort of suggestion. So
the first test gave a positive result. Marion’s assailant
was pretty certainly Morris.”</p>

<p>“I should like to have seen Mr. Polton’s ’prentice
effort,” said Marion, who had been listening, enthralled
by this description.</p>

<p>“You shall see it now,” Thorndyke replied with a
smile. “It is in the next room, concealed in a cupboard.”</p>

<p>He went out, and presently returned, carrying what
looked like an excessively crude hairdresser’s dummy, but
a most extraordinarily horrible and repulsive one. As
he turned the face towards us, Marion gave a little cry
of horror and then tried to laugh—without very striking
success.</p>

<p>“It is a dreadful-looking thing!” she exclaimed; “and
so hideously like that fiend.” She gazed at it with the
most extreme repugnance for a while, and then said,
apologetically: “I hope you won’t think me very silly,
but⸺”</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t,” Thorndyke interrupted. “It is
going back to its cupboard at once;” and with this he
bore it away, returning in a few moments with a smaller
object, wrapped in a cloth, which he laid on the table.
“Another ‘exhibit,’ as they say in the courts,” he
explained, “which we shall want presently. Meanwhile we
resume the thread of our argument.</p>

<p>“The photograph of this wax-work, then, furnished
corroboration of the theory that Morris was the man
whom we were seeking. My next move was to inquire
at Scotland Yard if there were any fresh developments of
the Van Zellen case. The answer was that there were;
and Superintendent Miller arranged to come and tell me
all about them. You were present at the interview and
will remember what passed. His information was highly
important, not only by confirming my inference that
Bendelow was the murderer, but especially by disposing
of the difficulty connected with the disappearance of your
patient. For now there came into view a second
man—Crile—who had died at Hoxton of an abdominal cancer
and had been duly buried; and when you were able to
give me this man’s address, a glance at the map and at
the Post Office Directory showed that the two men had
died in the same house. This fact, with the further facts
that they had died of virtually the same disease and
within a day or two of the same date, left no reasonable doubt
that we were really dealing with one man, who had died
and for whom two death certificates, in different names,
and two corresponding burial orders, had been obtained.
There was only one body, and that was cremated in the
name of Bendelow. It followed that the coffin which was
buried at Mr. Crile’s funeral must have been an empty
coffin. I was so confident that this must be so that I
induced Miller to apply for an exhumation, with the
results that you know.</p>

<p>“There now remained only a single point requiring
verification: the question as to what face it was that those
two ladies saw when they looked into the coffin of Simon
Bendelow. Here again Polton’s new accomplishments
came to our aid. From the plaster mask your apprentice
made a most realistic wax mask, which I offer for your
critical inspection.”</p>

<p>He unfolded the cloth and produced a mask of thin,
yellowish wax and of a most cadaverous aspect, which
he handed to Marion.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said approvingly, “it is an excellent piece
of work; and what beautiful eyelashes. They look
exactly like real ones.”</p>

<p>“They are real ones,” Thorndyke explained with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>She looked up at him inquiringly, and then, breaking
into a ripple of laughter, exclaimed: “Of course! They
are his own! Oh! How like Mr. Polton. But he was
quite right, you know. He couldn’t have got the effect
any other way.”</p>

<p>“So he declared,” said Thorndyke. “Well, we hired
a coffin and had an inspection window put in the lid, and
we got a black skull cap. We put a dummy head in the
coffin with a wig on it; we laid the mask where the face
should have been, and we adjusted the jaw-bandage and
the skull cap so as to cover up the edges of the mask, and
we got the two ladies here and showed them the coffin.
When they had identified the tenant as Mr. Bendelow, the
verification was complete. The hypothesis was now
converted into ascertained fact, and all that remained to be
done was to lay hands on the murderer.”</p>

<p>“How did you find out where Morris was living?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Barber did that,” he replied. “When I learned that
you were being stalked, I employed Barber to shadow
you. He, of course, observed Morris on your track and
followed him home.”</p>

<p>“That was what I supposed,” said I; and for a while
we were all silent. Presently Marion said: “It is all
very involved and confusing. Would you mind telling
us exactly what happened?”</p>

<p>“In a direct narrative, you mean?” said he. “Yes, I
will try to reconstruct the events in the order of their
occurrence. They began with the murder of Van Zellen
by Bendelow. There was no evidence against him at the
time, but he had to fly from America for other reasons,
and he left behind him incriminating traces which he
knew must presently be discovered, and which would fix
the murder on him. His friend, Crile, who fled with him,
developed gastric cancer, and had only a month or two
to live. Then Bendelow decided that when Crile should
die, he would make believe to die at the same time. To
this end, he commissioned your father to make a wax
mask—a portrait mask of himself with the eyes closed.
His wife must then have persuaded the two spinsters to
visit him—he, of course, taking to his bed when they
called, and being represented as a mortally sick man.
Then he moved from Hornsey to Hoxton, taking Crile
with him. There he engaged two doctors—Usher and
Gray, both of whom lived at a distance—to attend Crile,
and to visit him on alternate days. Crile seems to have
been deaf, or, at least, hard of hearing, and was kept
continuously under the influence of morphia. Usher,
who was employed by Mrs. Bendelow, whom he knew as
Mrs. Pepper, came to the front of the house, in
Field-street, to visit Mr. Crile, while Stephen—who was
employed by the Bendelows, whom he knew by the name of
Morris—entered at the rear of the house in Market-street,
to visit the same man under the name of Bendelow.
About the time of the move Bendelow committed the
murder in order to destroy all evidence of the making
of the wax mask.</p>

<p>“Eventually Crile died—or was finished off with an
extra dose of morphia—on a Thursday. Usher gave the
certificate, and the funeral took place on the Saturday.
But previously—probably on the Friday night—the coffin-lid
was unscrewed by Bendelow, the body taken out and
replaced by a sack of sawdust with some lead pipe in it.</p>

<p>“On the Monday the body was again produced: this
time as that of Simon Bendelow, who was represented as
having died on the Sunday afternoon. It was put in a
cremation coffin with a celluloid window in the lid. The
wax mask was placed over the face; the jaw-bandage and
the skull cap adjusted to hide the place where the wax
face joined the real face; and the two spinsters were
brought up to see Mr. Bendelow in his coffin. They
looked in through the window, and, of course, saw the
wax mask of Bendelow. They then retired. The coffin-lid
was taken off, the wax mask removed, the coffin-lid
screwed on again, and then the two doctors were brought
up. They removed the body from the coffin, examined
it, and put it back; and Bendelow—or Morris—put on the
coffin-lid.</p>

<p>“As soon as the doctors were gone, the coffin-lid was
taken off again, the wax mask was put back and adjusted,
and the coffin-lid replaced and screwed down finally.
Then the two ladies were brought up again to take a
last look at poor Mr. Bendelow; not actually the last look,
for, at the funeral they peeped in at the window and
saw the wax face just before the coffin was passed through
into the crematorium.”</p>

<p>“It was a diabolically clever scheme,” said I.</p>

<p>“It was,” he agreed. “It was perfectly convincing and
consistent. If you and those two ladies had been put
in the witness-box, your testimony and theirs would have
been in complete agreement. They had seen Simon
Bendelow (whom they knew quite well) in his coffin. A few
minutes later, you had seen Simon Bendelow in his coffin,
had taken the body out, examined it thoroughly, and put
it back, and had seen the coffin-lid screwed down, and
again a few minutes later, they had looked in through
the coffin-window and had again seen Simon Bendelow.
The evidence would appear to be beyond the possibility
of a doubt. Simon Bendelow was proved conclusively
to be dead and cremated and was doubly certified to have
died from natural causes. Nothing could be more
complete.</p>

<p>“And yet,” he continued, after a pause, “while we are
impressed by the astonishing subtlety and ingenuity
displayed, we are almost more impressed by the fundamental
stupidity exhibited along with it; a stupidity that seems
to be characteristic of this type of criminal. For all the
security that was gained by one part of the scheme was
destroyed by the idiotic efforts to guard against dangers
that had no existence. The murder was not only a foul
crime; it was a technical blunder of the most elementary
kind. But for that murder, Bendelow would now be alive
and in unchallenged security. The cremation scheme was
completely successful. It deceived everybody. Even the
two detectives, though they felt vague suspicions, saw no
loophole. They had to accept the appearances at their
face value.</p>

<p>“But it was the old story. The wrongdoer could not
keep quiet. He must be for ever making himself safer
and yet more safe. And at each move, he laid down fresh
tracks. And so, in the end, he delivered himself into
our hands.”</p>

<p>He paused and for a while seemed to be absorbed in
reflection on what he had been telling us. Presently he
looked up, and addressing Marion, said in grave, quiet
tones:</p>

<p>“We have ended our quest and we have secured
retribution. Justice was beyond our reach, for complete justice
implies restitution; and to attain that, the dead must have
been recalled from the grave. But, at least sometimes,
out of evil cometh good. Surely it will seem to you,
when, in the happy years which I trust and confidently
believe lie before you, your thoughts turn back to the
days of your mourning and grief, that the beloved father,
who, when living, made your happiness his chief concern,
even in dying, bequeathed to you a blessing.”</p>

<p>the end</p>
